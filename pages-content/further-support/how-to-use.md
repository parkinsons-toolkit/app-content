There are personalised sections (About Me, My Health, Symptom Review, My Well-being, My Tracker, Appointments and To Do Lists & Notes) which each aim to...

You might find it useful to consider what types of questions could help you to analyse the data you’ve entered into the tracker. For example:
- At what times of the day am I usually available to start a new exercise or activity?
- How do I typically feel after regularly completing a specific activity?
- What do I hope to learn from tracking this data, and how long do I plan to continue recording it?
- Is there a pattern between when I take specific medication and how I feel or notice certain symptoms? 

Here are some questions you might explore by entering data into the tracker:
- “_At what times of the day are my symptoms less severe?_”
- “_When does my medication wear off, am I taking it on time?_”
- “_On which days and at what times am I available to start a new habit?_”
- “_How many hours do I spend on a particular activity?_”

_**Tip 1:** Setting reminders can also be helpful. You might want to set monthly, 6-monthly, or pre-appointment reminders to look back at the toolkit and the data you have entered, such as using the symptom review section. For example, you can set a calendar reminder to log in to the toolkit regularly._

_**Tip 2:** It can be helpful to complete the symptom review section ahead of your appointments to help you reflect on your experiences and decide what you might like to focus on. You could even set calendar email reminders to complete this section in advance and print the pages to bring to your appointment._

Each section of the tracker has its own dedicated video tutorial to help you navigate and get the most out of the tracker (see below).
