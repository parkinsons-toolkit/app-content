## Topics Covered

- Accepting help
- Decisions about care
- What if more support is needed?
- Medical decisions
- Health & care priorities

## Accepting Help

It is common to fear needing help or losing independence. In many cultures, independence is highly valued, and accepting help can feel difficult.  
A more positive approach involves:

- Changing what can be changed
- Accepting what cannot be changed
- Learning to tell the difference

**This requires:**

- Reflection
- Self-evaluation
- Honesty with yourself

**Sources of help can include:**

- Parkinson’s specialist team
- GP team
- Community therapy services
- Social services
- Palliative care teams
- Citizens Advice Bureau
- Charities (e.g., Parkinson’s UK helpline, Age UK)

## Decisions About Your Care

Some people may be unable to make decisions due to Parkinson’s or other circumstances (e.g., after an accident).

**Questions to consider:**

- Who knows you well?
- Who could represent your views?
- Who do you consider wise?

**Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA):**

- **Health & Welfare LPA**: Makes health and care decisions on your behalf if you are unable.
- **Property & Financial Affairs LPA**: Manages money, property, and financial matters.

If no LPA is in place, professionals make decisions in your best interests, seeking to understand your wishes through recorded statements and speaking with those close to you.

## Advance Care Planning

**Advance Decision (ADRT / Living Will):**

- Legal document to refuse specific medical treatments under certain circumstances
- Can include refusal of life-sustaining treatment
- Cannot refuse basic care such as nursing care, food, and water by mouth
- Must be explicit, witnessed, and signed

**Advance Statement:**

- Records your preferences for future health and social care
- Not legally binding, but must be considered
- Can include:
  - Who should be involved in care decisions
  - Spiritual, cultural, or religious beliefs
  - Preferred location of care
  - Daily life preferences
  - Views on medical interventions
  - Wishes for after death

---

## If More Support Is Needed

If daily tasks become difficult, support options include:

- Carers for personal care
- Home adaptations (e.g., stair rails, walk-in shower)
- Equipment (e.g., commode, bed lever)

Support can be:

- Privately arranged
- Through Adult Social Care services
- A combination of both

**Housing Options:**

- Sheltered accommodation
- Assisted living / extra-care sheltered housing
- Residential care homes
- Nursing care homes

## Paying for Care

- NHS healthcare: Free for those eligible
- Social care: Means-tested (financial assessment required)
- Adult Social Care services: Provide support for daily living, arrange equipment and adaptations, and assess costs
- NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC): Fully funded care for complex health needs, determined by assessment
- Fast Track CHC: For those with rapidly deteriorating health nearing end of life
- NHS-funded nursing care: Contribution towards nursing costs in a care home if CHC is not granted

---

## Medical Decisions

### Food & Drink

- Providing food and drink by mouth is considered basic care and will always be offered
- Some people develop swallowing difficulties, increasing risk of pneumonia and malnutrition
- Options:
  - Continue eating/drinking by mouth despite risks
  - Use a feeding tube for nutrition and medication
- Swallowing assessments are done by Speech & Language Therapists
- Tube feeding reduces but does not eliminate risks and should be considered alongside quality of life factors

---

## Artificial Nutrition & Hydration

- Used when swallowing is unsafe or impossible
- Risks and benefits vary per person
- Requires input from:
  - Speech & Language Therapists
  - Specialist dietitians
  - Doctors
  - Nurses
- Quality of life considerations are essential, as food and drink are often sources of pleasure
- **Intravenous fluid:** Fluid can be given through a small drip into a small vein, such as in the arm or hand. It must be done cautiously as it affects the body’s usual regulation of fluid intake.

- **Nasogastric (NG) tube or nasojejunal (NJ) tube:** These are tubes inserted through the nose that go down into the gut. This is to deliver food, water and/or medicine directly.

- **Gastrostomy – (sometimes called ‘PEG’ or ‘RIG’):** These are tubes inserted by a surgical procedure. This sometimes involves a camera being inserted from the mouth (endoscopic guided) and sometimes involves special x-rays (radiologically guided) to guide placement. The tube connects from outside the body, through the skin into the stomach. The tubes can be used for food, water and/or medicine. Sometimes the tube is extended on the inside to reach into the small intestine (sometimes called PEG-J). This is the same method as for Duodopa, discussed on the Advanced & Surgical Treatments page.

- **Intravenous nutrition:** In very specific circumstances, liquid food can be given through a big drip into a big vein (such as in the neck). Food given in this way has significant risks related to it. It is therefore only undertaken in very special circumstances, such as for people whose bowels don’t work.

In general, people are awake for insertion of drip lines and NG or NJ tubes. Gastrostomy insertion usually involves local anaesthetic injection into the skin and sedating medicine via a drip.

Small drips and NG/NJ tubes are short-term options. The insertion can be uncomfortable or even painful but most people get used to them once they are in. Sometimes they become dislodged and need to be re-inserted. There is a very small risk of infection or bleeding from these procedures.

Gastrostomy tubes are longer term, but involve a more invasive procedure and higher risk of complication. This can include infection. They too can sometimes become dislodged and need to be re-inserted. They can also be distressing if someone becomes confused or has a cognitive impairment.

## Medical decisions about medication

All medicines have risks and benefits. This can be a tricky balance. It varies between individuals and changes over time. Medicines play different roles:

- **Some** are for treatment of life-threatening illness, such as antibiotics for serious infections.
- **Some** are to improve symptoms, such as Parkinson’s medicines.
- **Some** are to prevent problems in the future, such as cholesterol-lowering medicines.

The decision about which to take should consider what the medicine is for, the potential side effects, and the requirements to give it (e.g. if it needs a hospital admission to give via a drip). As such, potentially beneficial medicine may not be used if the risks outweigh those benefits.

Note: Oxygen is also a medicine and must be prescribed. It has risks and benefits, so the same principles apply.

A person may make the decision that they no longer want to go to hospital for medical care. This may mean that they are happy to have tablet antibiotics, which can be given at home, but may decide not to have antibiotics which must be given directly into a vein, which would normally require hospital admission.

## Medical decisions about critical care interventions

Critical Care Interventions are given for life-threatening illness, in a closely monitored hospital environment. Various machines may be used to do the role of body organs that are not working properly. Examples include:

- **Support for breathing:** This may be a tight-fitting mask that pushes air in and out while the person is awake (‘Non-invasive ventilation’), or a tube into the lungs (‘Intubation’) with sedation (‘invasive ventilation’).
- **Support for the kidneys:** A dialysis-like machine connected via a big drip line removes waste from the blood before returning it to the body.
- **Support for heart and circulation:** Special medicines given via big drip lines with close monitoring. Occasionally, more specialist machines pump blood around the body.

These machines do not cure the underlying problem — they give time for the body to fight or for direct treatments to work. They put the body under stress and do not work for all medical problems.

Decisions about critical care interventions are complex and should involve experienced professionals. Carers should not feel solely responsible for such decisions.

## Medical decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)

CPR refers to medical interventions for someone whose heart and/or breathing has stopped:

- **Chest compressions:** Repeated hard pushing on the chest to circulate blood.
- **Ventilation:** Moving air in and out of the lungs, either manually or by machine.
- **Defibrillation:** Electrical shocks delivered to the heart in certain abnormal rhythms.
- **Medicines:** Given via drip or into a bone to increase CPR effectiveness.

CPR is often unsuccessful. Even when the heart restarts, new medical problems often arise.

People can choose to have a **do-not-resuscitate (DNR)** order, which is a medical order written by a doctor.

## Your rights regarding medical decisions

- You have the right to decline any medical treatment if:
  - You have mental capacity.
  - You are informed.
  - You decide voluntarily.
- If you lack capacity, principles in “Decisions about your Care” apply.
- UK law does not give the right to demand unsuitable treatment.
- “Advanced Decision to refuse life sustaining treatment” is a legal record with specific rules.
- Good communication with healthcare professionals is essential.

## Health & care priorities

Decisions are based on weighing pros and cons:

- Likelihood of risks and benefits is unique to each person.
- Importance of risks and benefits is personal (e.g. drowsiness, injections, hospital stays).

### Changes over time

- Older people or those with more health conditions are less likely to recover well and more likely to experience harm from treatments.
- Priorities shift:
  - Earlier life: length of life often prioritised.
  - Later life: quality of life often prioritised.
  - Near end of life: comfort and environment prioritised.

Keep loved ones and professionals updated as your views change.
