# Parkinson's Toolkit - Content Repository

This repository contains the content files for the [Parkinson's Toolkit app](https://github.com/parkinsons-toolkit/parkinsons-toolkit-app) - a web application designed to provide evidence-based information and support for people living with Parkinson's disease, their families, and caregivers.

## Content Management

### Adding text content

Content maintainers can edit the markdown files in `./pages-content` in this repository. Changes are automatically reflected in the web application without requiring redeployments.

Make sure the name of the `.md` file is the same as the URL you would like the page to be accessed from in the app. For example, the file `what-is-parkinsons.md` would be accessed in the web app from `app-domain/what-is-parkinsons`. Use dashes `-` as separators and avoid using special characters.

### Adding image content

Images can be stored in `./images` and inserted into the markdown files directly with:

`<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/main/images/linked-image-name.png" alt="example-alt-text" class="example-class">`

The branch name in the image URL will automatically be replaced with either `main` or `dev` during the web application runtime.

### Adding video content

Videos can be pulled in from external sources such as embedded YouTube videos. These can be inserted as an `iframe` with e.g:

```
<div class="video-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikVplhl5zZw" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
```

## Security Guidelines for Content Contributors

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This repository supports HTML within markdown to enable rich content (videos, styled elements). Please follow these security guidelines:

**‚úÖ SAFE PRACTICES:**

- Use standard markdown syntax for text, headers, lists, and links
- Embed YouTube videos using provided HTML templates
- Add images using standard markdown image syntax

**‚ùå NEVER ADD:**

- `<script>` tags or JavaScript code
- Event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, `onmouseover`, etc.)
- Form elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>` with actions)
- External iframes from non-approved domains
- Suspicious or unfamiliar HTML code from external sources

**üîç REVIEW PROCESS:**

- All content changes require pull request review
- Reviewers should check for suspicious HTML elements
- When in doubt, ask the development team about HTML additions
- Test content locally when possible before submitting

**üìã APPROVED HTML ELEMENTS:**

- `<div class="video-container">` for YouTube embeds
- `<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/...">` for approved videos
- `<img>` tags with GitHub raw URLs for images
- Basic styling divs with approved CSS classes

If you need to add new HTML elements or are unsure about content safety, please consult with the development team first.

## Web Application Integration

This content repository is designed to be dynamically consumed by a web application:

- **Markdown files** are fetched from GitHub and rendered in real-time
- **Content updates** are immediate - no build process required

## Use of git branches

Use the `dev` branch to test out new content ideas.

When you are happy, open a pull request to merge your changes into `main`.

The web application will automatically use the content from the `dev` branch for local development and `main` during production.
