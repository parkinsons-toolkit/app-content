# Appointments & Hospital Stays

---

## Appointments

Most people with Parkinson’s remain under the care of a specialist (usually a Neurologist or Geriatrician) for life. They usually see them every 6–12 months. In addition, in many areas there are also Parkinson’s Nurse Specialists, working either in the community or in the hospital. Some of these specialist nurses hold outpatient appointments, and most do telephone calls. A few will see people in their own homes. You may also have appointments with other teams, either in relation to your Parkinson’s or for other health reasons.

Appointments can be stressful, and stress tends to make Parkinson’s symptoms worse. The best way to reduce the stress and make the most out of your appointment is to plan ahead. Here are some things you may wish to consider beforehand:

### Do you want someone to come with you?

This should be someone you trust. It might be for emotional support, to help you remember what is said by the professional you see, or to help describe your experiences to the professional if they know you well. It is up to you whether or not someone else comes in with you – if you want privacy they can wait outside.

### How will you get there?

So that getting to the appointment is not a cause of stress you could check out the directions to the appointment in advance. You could also allow yourself plenty of time so that you are not pressured. If the appointment is at a hospital, they will often send out details of where to go. This is usually with the appointment letter. There should also be a telephone number to contact if you need more information.

<ins>Hospital transport:</ins> Hospitals can provide transport to appointments in specific circumstances. This must be planned ahead. To book this they will need to know how much help you will need. There should be information about hospital transport in your appointment letter. If not call the number on your appointment letter as soon as possible.

### Do you need an interpreter?

Hospitals and GP surgeries should have interpretation services available. This will need to be planned ahead. There may be information in your appointment letter. If not call the number on your appointment letter as soon as possible to request an interpreter.

### What do you want out of it?

It is helpful to think about what you are expecting from the appointment. It is also helpful to think about any specific questions you wish to ask. Many people find it helpful to write them down. Appointment times can feel very short, and the healthcare professional will have questions to ask you. It is helpful to both understand each other’s expectations at the start. It may not be possible to cover everything in that one appointment. It is helpful to think if you can prioritise your concerns, perhaps by writing a numbered list.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/gp-appointment.jpg" alt="appointment" class="example-class">



### What to bring?

- Any medication you need to take during the time you will be at the appointment. Also some water to take them with.
- An up-to-date list of your medication. If this is not possible the medication packets can be helpful. Please note that many tablets look similar so bringing loose tablets or describing what they look like cannot be relied upon.
- Your list of questions.
- Pen and paper (or digital equivalent) if you wish to make any notes.
- Any important documents from other professionals that relate your health. At present, different hospital, GP and community service computer systems are <ins>not</ins> necessarily all linked up. This means that records may be held in one place but not another.
- Some entertainment in case of a lengthy wait. Perhaps a book, newspaper or personal music.
- A drink and possibly something to eat. Hospitals can be very hot, and it is important to stay hydrated, especially if you have a long wait.

It can be frustrating to bring some of these things, like medications lists or past medical documents, if no one looks at them. They might look at them next time, so try not to be put off. It is more frustrating if decisions cannot be made between yourself and the healthcare professional because of missing information.

### Helpful Tips for Your Appointment

Here are some pointers to help you prepare for your appointment with your Neurologist or Parkinson’s specialist:

- Appointments are a valuable time to explore and discuss your Parkinson’s with a specialist. It’s common to wonder what to ask during your visit. Consider the following topics:
  - ‘Has your Parkinson’s changed over time and if so, how?’
  - ‘Is your current treatment plan working?’ – For example, have you noticed any improvements in certain symptoms, or have some symptoms stopped or are getting worse. If yes, make a note of these changes and what is happening so you can discuss these with your specialist.
  - ‘Have you noticed any medication side effects?’
  - ‘What symptoms are you experiencing, even if you don’t think they are related to Parkinson’s, do make a note and mention it to your specialist’
  - ‘Are there any symptoms that are particularly challenging or that are affecting your day-to-day life?’ Think about what is troublesome to you and discuss these concerns with your specialist.

Appointments are also an opportunity to ask questions about your condition and discuss your expectations, concerns and ideas with your specialist.

_Tip 1: Don’t forget your medication list._

_Tip 2: It can be helpful to think about what your top 3 priorities are that you’d like to discuss with your specialist e.g., your most troubling symptoms, any changes you’ve noticed, or issues related to your medication response. This can help focus the conversation and ensure you cover your most important topics during the time you have with your specialist._

- Using the Personalised sections of this toolkit may help you make the most of your appointments, by remembering what has happened between appointments, for example:
  - **The tracker –** keep track of symptoms and any changes between appointments
  - **Appointments section –** review previous discussions and prepare for upcoming ones
  - **Symptom review –** regularly assess your symptoms and how they affect your quality of life

Of course, while no preparation is needed for your appointments, you can make the most of your time with your specialist by thinking about what matters most to you and making a note of any key questions or concerns.

## Staying in Hospital

There are many different reasons people need to stay in hospital. As well as being a stressful time, the different environment means there are lots of things to think about. Here we discuss how to make the hospital stays as smooth as possible. Going into hospital can be planned or unplanned.

A planned stay is called an **Elective Admission**. This would be for a planned knee operation for example.  
An unplanned stay is due to an **Emergency Admission**. An example of this would be following a fall.

Whichever way you go into hospital it is important for staff to know you have Parkinson’s. This is to make sure you have appropriate care throughout your hospital stay. Remember, the hospital has to follow your timetable for your medication, so you must let them know what times you take your medication.

</div>

### Preparation

- If you know you are going to be admitted to hospital, discuss with your Parkinson’s specialist team in advance, if possible.
- Some people have alert cards or alert bracelets to say that they have Parkinson’s in case of an emergency.
- Some people keep a pack with their vital health documents where it can be found quickly in an emergency.

### What to bring?

- **Medication**: An up-to-date list of your medication. If this is not possible, the medication packets can be helpful. Please note that many tablets look similar so bringing loose tablets or describing what they look like cannot be relied upon. It is usually a good idea to take a short supply of medication. They need to be in their original packets to be used in hospital.
  - Bring a list with the times that you take your medication.
- **Documents**: Any important documents from other professionals that relate your health. At present, different hospital, GP and community service computer systems are <ins>not</ins> necessarily all linked up. This means that records may be held in one place but not another. It is helpful to bring the contact details of your Parkinson’s specialist team.
- **Aids**: such as dentures, hearing aids, glasses, walking stick.
- **Clothes & toiletries**: Bring your normal clothes to get dressed into if you are well enough or when leaving hospital. You may also want to bring your own pyjamas, dressing gown and well-fitting slippers. If staying overnight, you will also need toiletries e.g. toothbrush, toothpaste, soap, shampoo, flannel etc.
- **Other items**: Visitors can be restricted in hospital wards, due to a risk of infection. To help with feeling lonely, some people like to bring photographs of their pet or close family or friends. It also helps to have a ‘smart’ device such as a smart phone or a tablet, you can use to see your family or friends. The staff can help you with using this if you are unfamiliar with using these.

#### Sharing information

When someone is going to stay in the hospital, personal and health information is recorded as a standard process. Accurate up-to-date information is essential to provide the best care. If an admission is planned, information may be asked in advance, but if it is unplanned, it will be asked on arrival. In addition to administrative details, expect to be asked about:

- Specific questions related to the reason for your admission
- Health conditions
- Medications – remember to give the times you take your Parkinson’s medication
- Allergies
- Living arrangements
- Your support: People, equipment and aids

Make sure you tell staff you have Parkinson’s. It is helpful to give the contact details of your Parkinson’s specialist team. If it is a planned hospital admission they can liaise in advance. There is often overlap in the questions that different healthcare professionals ask and it can be frustrating to repeat. Consider using the _About Me_ and _My Health_ pages to record some of this key information. Then you can show the summary to multiple people, clarifying details as needed.

If you are being treated with an advanced therapy or if you are on an experimental treatment, it is essential to tell the staff looking after you about it as soon as possible. These are highly specialised treatments so many healthcare professionals will not know much about them and the hospital may need to obtain them specifically. It is helpful if you can provide the details of your treatment and the team that look after it. _You should also have been provided by the team looking after these therapies with advice on what to do if you are admitted to hospital._

See extra information below for a list of advanced therapies.

- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
- Apomorphine pump
- Intraduodenal levodopa gel infusion (e.g. Duodopa)

It is important for staff to know you have Parkinson’s and know your specific requirements and routine, such as:

- **Dietary requirements** and if you need help with food and drink.
- **Personal care** such as whether you need help going to the toilet, washing and dressing
- **Sleep** needs
- **Medication:** Getting your medication on time is important. The times you usually take your medicines may not be the same as medications are given on the ward. Make sure to tell the staff what times you need to take your medication. Some hospitals have self-medication policies. If you do take your own medications, ensure the healthcare staff know that you have

### Who’s who?

You will probably encounter lots of different professionals during your hospital stay. See <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies/who-may-be-involved" class="internal-link">_Who May Be Involved_</a> for more guidance on roles but always feel free to ask.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/nurse.jpg" alt="nurse" class="example-class">


### Responsibilities you may still have outside hospital

Many people worry about things that they have left at home if they are admitted to hospital. Although it is good to have motivation for your recovery, it is preferable to minimise anxiety around things back at home. Some things to think about:

- **Work**: Can you or a friend or relative let your workplace know that you will be off sick.
- **Dependents**: If you normally care for someone, is there someone who can step in to help while you are in hospital? If they are a vulnerable adult or a child then social services can provide emergency care. Tell the team looking after you and they can notify social services. The following website provides information about the sorts of support they can offer: <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Social care and support guide</a>
- **Pets**: Is there someone who can step in to help while you are in hospital?
- **Security and safety**: If you are worried about whether you locked the door, or left the cooker on, is there someone who could check to put your mind at ease? Is there someone who can check on your home whilst you are in hospital?
- **Bills**: Is there someone who can step in to help while you are in hospital?

## Minimising Hospital Risks

Unfortunately, complications do happen. The hospital is different to the place where you usually live and has different risks. Here are some suggestions to help reduce these risks.

<div class="video-container">

  height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2zpjw67BciQ"

</iframe>
</div>

### Medication

Parkinson’s medication regimes can be very complicated. This is particularly so for those who are unfamiliar with them. Medication errors in hospital are unfortunately still too common. There are many initiatives out there to help reduce them. What can you do to help?

- Make sure the team looking after you know you have Parkinson’s and know your usual medication regime, including the timings
- Medication may be changed while you are in hospital. You are entitled to discuss any changes with the staff looking after you
- If you notice a mistake with your medications, tell the staff looking after you
- **In general**, if a question is about the reasons for a particular medication or medication change then ask the prescriber. This will usually be the doctor. If the question is about which tablet you are given, then ask the person giving it. This will usually be the nurse. Pharmacists may be able to help with both aspects
- Your Parkinson’s medication should not be stopped suddenly. Some investigations and scans, and some operations (more detail below) need a period of fasting beforehand, but <ins>Parkinson’s medication can usually still be given</ins>. If you have been told not to eat and drink (often referred to as _Nil By Mouth_, _NBM_) do question whether you can still have your Parkinson’s medication

### Infection

Acquiring infection in hospital is a risk. To reduce this:

- Encourage your visitors to follow any local advice aimed at reducing spread of infection. This may include such activities as hand washing.
- Sometimes being ill distracts from normal hygiene habits you have. So you might have to think more actively about personal hygiene, such as washing hands after using the toilet. Ask for help if needed to carry out these activities.

### Deconditioning

Changes occur in the body during prolonged rest, such as during a hospital stay. Muscle strength, mobility, thinking and motivation can all deteriorate over time. These together can lead to someone being less able than they were before. Ways to reduce this:

- Make sure you eat and drink well.
- Do as much as you can for yourself.
- Keep moving. If you are unable to walk around, then keep moving your arms and legs from within a chair or bed.
- Where possible, sit in a chair or walk in daytime and sleep in bed at night.
- If being active is causing pain, speak to the staff looking after you so they can address the pain, rather than let it stop you.

### Eating & Drinking

People often experience a poor appetite when unwell. Hospital meals may not be to your taste or not served at your usual time. However, to make sure your body has the strength it needs to recover, it is important to eat well. It is also important to maintain hydration, by drinking enough. Doing both these things can help to reduce the risk of complications. Tips for achieving this:

- Can family or friends bring in different food to meet your taste and timing preferences? If so, let the hospital team know about it, particularly if you have particular dietary restrictions.
- Tell the ward staff if you need help eating or drinking.
- Ensure you have a drink at your bedside and have regular sips throughout the day.

Maintaining a healthy diet and good hydration whilst in hospital will also help prevent constipation. If you are getting constipated, tell the team looking after you sooner rather than later. They may prescribe medication for this or advise on a higher fibre diet.

### Falls

The different environment, as well as changes in the body, lead to higher risk of falls in hospital. Having said that, it is important not to let fear of falls keep you in bed all of the time which risks deconditioning. Ways to reduce risk of falls in hospital:

- Make sure ward staff know what help you need – whether that is equipment or a person.
- Make sure you know how to call for help. Most hospitals have an alarm system with a button to press.
- Wear appropriate footwear.
- Stand up slowly to reduce dizziness.

## Delirium

Delirium is a dysfunction of the brain that can occur when the body is put under additional stress. This includes if someone is unwell in hospital. It shows as changes in alertness (either drowsiness, hyperactivity, or both), attention and orientation. Many people describe this as being confused. It can affect the way someone behaves. Delirium varies over the day(s) and can disrupt sleep patterns.

Typical causes include:

- Infections and other medical problems
- Medication
- Abnormal blood chemistry (e.g. high or low blood sugar levels or blood calcium levels)
- Pain
- Dehydration
- Sleep deprivation
- Surgery/anaesthetic

Risk of delirium is much greater in hospital. This can be made worse by being in a different and unfamiliar environment.

If you have delirium, things that help:

- Staff and visitors should re-introduce themselves each time they interact
- Staff and visitors can gently and regularly re-orientate you. This can be done by reminding you what day or time it is, where you are etc.
- Prompts to help you keep orientated: Clocks, date displays, newspapers and signs with names of people or the place.
- Viewing familiar things, such as photographs of loved ones.
- Try to maintain a normal day-night sleep-wake cycle. Avoid daytime naps if possible.
- Staying hydrated.

### Undergoing surgery

Many of the same principles as discussed above apply. People undergoing surgery are at a higher risk of delirium.

It is important that if you are having a General Anaesthetic (put to sleep) for the operation that the anaesthetist knows you have Parkinson’s. This is because can influence their choice of anaesthetic, pain relief and anti-sickness medicines.

Managing medications around surgery can be complicated. This is particularly so if it is a long operation. This should be considered before the surgery takes place. Although people are required to have an empty stomach before a general anaesthetic, the needs for not having food are different to the need for medicines. For this reason, try to ask about this to make sure you do not unnecessarily miss medication. In some cases, medication may be given via a tube into the stomach or via a patch on the skin during surgery.

Some medications given in the hospital (for example medicines to reduce pain) can interact with the medications you take for your Parkinson’s. They can cause confusion, dizziness or nausea, for example. It is important to always let staff know if you don’t feel right in any way.

## Hospital policies

Local hospital policies widely vary, from parking charges through to visiting hours. Different ways of communicating information to friends and relatives are used in different hospitals. If you want more information about how something works in your hospital, ask a member or staff or try looking at the hospital website. There are however a few areas that are the same across the NHS that it may be helpful to know about.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/hospital.jpg" alt="hospital" class="example-class">


### Single rooms and open wards

Single rooms are not standard for NHS care. Availability of single rooms varies place to place. They are sometimes required due to the risk of infection spread and for some specific personal circumstances. There may also be reasons for not using a single room. This might be, for example, the space needed for equipment, risk of isolation, or so that staff can more easily observe someone’s condition. If you are unsure why you are in a particular room or bed, talk to your named nurse or the nurse in charge. If you wish to be cared for in a private hospital or on a private wing of an NHS hospital, then you or your family can arrange it if practical. Sometimes you may be put in a close observation ward due to having Parkinson’s. As these wards tend to have a nurse around at all times, they will also tend to have people with dementia in them. Do not be alarmed if this is the case.

### Risk assessment for blood clots

Everyone staying in hospital is assessed for their risk of developing blood clots. This is a medical ‘risk-benefit decision process’ that guides the formulation of a plan. This plan may sometimes involve a small daily injection of a blood thinning medicine to reduce the risk of blood clots. If you have any questions, ask the team looking after you.

### Preventing spread of infection

Staff are trained in hand washing and hygienic approaches to help control spread of infections. They should wash their hands or use cleaning gel between every patient contact. In some circumstances additional measures are required such as gloves, aprons or masks, to prevent spread of infection.

Visitors should wash their hands or use cleaning gel on entering and exiting the ward. They may be asked to take additional measures (e.g. gloves, aprons, masks) if deemed necessary. If you have any questions, ask the team looking after you. If you notice a nurse coming to attend to you has not washed their hands, you must ask them to wash their hands – this is your right.

---

### Complaints & compliments

If you are not happy about your care, you can consider talking to the team looking after you. All hospitals will have procedures in place for dealing with incidents that occur in hospital. These are also in place to deal with complaints or compliments that are made. You can ask the team looking after you to direct you to more information, or there are some national organisations who help:

- England – **PALS:** Patient Advice & Liaison Service
- Scotland – **PASS:** Patient Advice & Support Service
- Wales – **Community Health Council**

Other advocates include charities e.g. Parkinson’s UK and the advocacy and information service _POhWER_. Also your <a href="https://www.healthwatch.co.uk/your-local-healthwatch/list" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local healthwatch</a> can help.

More information is available on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Website</a>.

---

## Discharge from hospital

Before you leave hospital, there are various plans that need to be put in place:

### Support

Has there been a change in what you are able to do that might mean you should have different support at home? This might be temporary while you continue to recover. It might be longer term.  
A range of professionals can assess your needs.  
This will consider tasks you undertake in your daily life. The professional who will complete this will depend on the circumstances.

---

### My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> So, they said they could make sure he can get up a couple of steps. And I think the stair-lift had to be fitted before he come home. And they had to assess the house and all that.
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

---

### Medication

There is a process of providing a list of medication that you should be taking on discharge from the hospital. Also, for providing sufficient supply if you do not already have it. It is important that the hospital team lets you, your GP and Parkinson’s specialist team know of any medication changes. They should also include the reasons for any changes. Bear in mind it can take a week or so for the GP to be made aware of any medicine changes. You may need to talk to your GP soon after discharge to go through these changes.

You may need further medical input to follow-up after your admission. This may be at the hospital or via your GP. In some cases the exact appointment will not be made before you leave hospital. It is important to make sure you understand what the plan is:

- Are you to make an appointment with your GP yourself?
- Are you to expect a letter about a hospital appointment?

Note it is important to communicate any changes in your living arrangements. This is to make sure that information is sent to the correct place for you to receive it. You may have changed your address or plan to be staying with someone else for a time after discharge, for example.

## Decision making

Decisions about health and care should be taken together with your healthcare professional. This is shared decision making. The healthcare professional gives you advice, and you have the final decision. This does not mean you can demand a treatment that is not thought to be right for you by professionals, but that you are in control of your care.

Sometimes thinking and memory problems can interfere with a person’s ability to make decisions. If this is the case, they may ‘lack capacity’ to make the decision. Capacity can be different for different decisions, this is usually due to complexity. It can also vary over time. See <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">_Legal Matters_</a> for more information on what happens if someone ‘lacks capacity’ for the decisions around their care.

If someone lacks capacity to consent to the hospital admission and care, and they require constant supervision, then a legal process must be followed. This is known as ‘Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards’ (DOLS). This is to protect them and make sure decisions are taken in their ‘best interests’. In some cases this may involve keeping them in hospital even when they say they want to go home.

This is if being treated in hospital is in their best interests.

Some people will have a Power of attorney in place, in which case the healthcare professionals will include them in decision making. Please see <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">_Legal Matters_</a> for further details about this.

If someone has a mental health problem that causes them to be at serious risk to themselves or others, then a legal framework may be used to make some health decisions for them. This could be to stay in hospital, or for treatment for the mental health problem. The law that is followed is the Mental Health Act.
