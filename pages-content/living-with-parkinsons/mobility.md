Mobility
Introduction
Mobility is quite a broad term and includes:
- Walking around
- Getting up or down stairs
- Getting in and out of bed
- Rolling over in bed: ‘bed mobility’
- Getting up from or sitting down into a chair.
Reduced mobility may make everyday activities more challenging for you than they used to be.
There are many things you can do for yourself. It is also advised that you see a physiotherapist or
occupational therapist. They will work with you to help you continue doing the things you need
and enjoy doing in your daily life.
Symptoms of Parkinson’s and factors unrelated to Parkinson’s can all contribute to reduced
mobility. These factors are discussed on the Balance & Falls page. Treatment of the symptoms
causing problems is important for maintaining mobility. Please explore the Symptom
Management pages for specific guidance.
A common problem is that difficulties mobilising mean that you are less active. Being less active
then leads to muscle weakness and stiffness. Muscle weakness and stiffness then leads to more
difficulty in mobilising. Lack of confidence and fear of falling also feeds into this cycle. It is
important to break this cycle.
What should I do about it?
If you have a sudden decline in your mobility, you should see your GP or contact your Parkinson’s
team as soon as possible. There may be an illness, injury or medication that is contributing to it.
Please see the Balance & Falls information page if these are concerns.
If you have difficulties moving, you should be referred to a physiotherapist. In the NHS, you usually
have to be referred by your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. You may also benefit from
Occupational Therapist or Adult Social Care services.
Appointments with these specialists may be in a hospital, community service, or at home. In some
areas there are specialist Parkinson’s teams or rehab services. Your Parkinson’s specialist team or
GP should be able to advise. See the Who May be Involved page for more information about the
different services.
What can I try for myself?
Keep Active
It is important to try to stay as active as possible, unless you
have been advised otherwise. Staying active helps you
maintain muscle strength and balance so helps maintain
mobility. It is also good for your Parkinson’s and general
health. There are different components to the activity you
should try to undertake: Strength, balance and flexibility.
Mobility requires all of these.
In Parkinson’s, specific attention also needs to be given to:
- Making big movements
- Carrying out more than one task at a time, known as ‘dual-tasking’.
Exercises to achieve these need to be tailored to your ability and needs. For more on all of these aspects,
see the Keeping Active page.
There may also be specific tasks that you can practice to address specific day-to-day challenges.
Physiotherapists and Occupational therapists help identify these where possible.
Mobility tips
- Give yourself time.
- Reduce unnecessary distractions.
- Where possible, it will also help to address other factors affecting your mobility. This might be
pain, tiredness, stress or urinary symptoms. See our Managing Symptoms pages for tips for
addressing each of these.
- Ensure you have appropriate footwear. Low heels or flat soles are better, and solid shoes with
good support are better. Try to avoid unsupportive shoes, such as flip-flops, floppy slippers, or
high heels.
- Think about your posture: Parkinson’s can cause you to stoop, but some of this can be
overcome. Try to stand tall and keep reminding yourself to straighten up.
- Think about your movements: Parkinson’s can cause movements to get smaller, but some of
this can be overcome. Try to think about big movements, including big steps, lifting your feet
off the floor, and keep reminding yourself.
Environment
- Ensure adequate lighting.
- Try to minimise obstacles, like clutter on the floor or trailing cables.
- Consider the surface you are walking on – watch out for wet floor or
loose rugs.
- Be careful what you lean on – don’t lean on something that might
itself fall over or come off a wall.
- Are there patterned surfaces that make it harder to judge distances, for example patterned
carpets?
- Consider applying a strip of coloured tape to the edge of steps/stairs. This will highlight them
and make it easier to judge the step.
- How accessible are the things that you use regularly?
Safety
- Recognise your limits.
- Have a back-up plan – how could you get help if you ran into trouble? This
might be for example, keeping your mobile phone in your pocket.
For tips related to daily tasks, including getting in and out of bed, please see the Daily Living page.
Equipment and Aids
Some people need equipment or aids in order to continue tasks of daily life.
It is strongly recommended that you see a physiotherapist and occupational therapist to
advise on these.
Before purchasing equipment, consider the following overall tips below:
- Consider how and where you will use the equipment
- Try the equipment before you buy it
- Ensure the fit of the equipment is as correct as possible
- Remember that companies selling equipment could be biased. Health and Social care professionals
do not have a financial incentive so are impartial.
- The Disabled Living Foundation (DLF) is a charity (not commercial) that provides detailed information
about equipment, including places you can try it out and comparisons of products.
Contact details for DLF are provided in our More information section.
Walking sticks
- Walking sticks are suitable for some people but not for others. It is
best to be assessed by a physiotherapist.
- Some people find them helpful for specific circumstances, e.g. in
crowds or for longer outings
- A benefit may be that others around can see that you need more
space
- There are many different styles:
- Wooden
- Metal - folding, collapsible, three or four-footed o Footed
sticks – note these are often heavier o Nordic poles –
lightweight, thin
- Sticks with seats attached – note these are often heavier
Note heavier sticks may be more difficult to walk with.
- The fit of the walking stick is very important. Size should be checked when you are wearing your
regular footwear. You should consult a physiotherapist but as a rough guide:
- Standing with your arms relaxed by your side, with a slight natural bend at your elbow:
The height of the stick should typically be at the level of your wrist crease.
- Buying a walking stick o You may be able to borrow or get one for free through the
NHS o They can be bought at mobility shops, some large pharmacies, or online.
Walking frames
- Walking frames are suitable for some people but not for others. It is best to be assessed by a
physiotherapist.
- Walking frames redistribute weight from legs to arms and come in different types.
- They give a higher level of support than walking sticks
- Zimmer walking frame, or non-wheeled walking frame o Pro: very stable o Con: person has to stop
and lift frame after each step
- Wheeled walking frames o Can have two, three, or four wheels o May have small, hard wheels
(lighter, and better for smooth surfaces); or larger, tyre-style wheels (better for outdoor & rougher
surfaces)
- Other features to consider:
- If it has a basket or seat and where they are located o If it collapses and if it will fit
through doorways at home, on the bus, in the car o If it will be easy to push, and if it
can easily ‘get away’ from you o Brakes – how they work and if your hands have any
difficulty using them
- The fit of the walking frame is very important. You should consult a physiotherapist but as a rough
guide:
- Standing with your arms relaxed by your side, with a slight natural bend at your elbow:
The frame hand grips should typically be at the level of the wrist.
Wheelchairs
- Some people need to use wheelchairs to get around. It is best to be assessed by a physiotherapist to
consider other options first.
- It might be for occasional use, e.g. bad days, or longer outings, or frequent use.
- There is a lot to consider when selecting a wheelchair. Wheelchair services can provide more
guidance. Considerations include: o Your mobility, posture, height and weight, sight, perception,
etc.
- The person pushing a manual wheelchair has to
be fairly physically fit
- For more frequent use, you should have a full
seating assessment by a professional.
- You can be referred to the wheelchair service
by your GP or another healthcare professional.
For equipment related to daily tasks, including getting in and out of bed,
please see the Daily Living page. For adaptations to the home environment, please see the
Housing page.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I mean, I can still walk around the house without using a stick. I use a stick when I walk
outside. When I’m really on, I wouldn’t need it. But it’s one of those things whereby it flags
to people that you’ve got an issue” (Person with Parkinson’s)

Reading, Writing and Technology
Introduction
Reading, writing, and using technology may be more difficult for people with Parkinson’s. This can
be due to a combination of factors, and we will explore each issue in detail below.
Reading
Why can it be difficult with Parkinson’s?
Eye movements involved in reading are highly complex and must be coordinated in order to track
words on a page.
- Saccadic eye movements are the rapid eye
movements that allow the eyes to quickly jump to
a new target. These are important for the eyes to
jump to a new line on the page. In Parkinson’s,
these movements can be slow, and it can be hard
to find the right spot on the next line to continue
reading. These eye movements can also become
fast if you are experiencing dyskinesias.
- Vergence eye movements are the eye movements needed for seeing an object up close or far
away. These eye movements are important when focusing on a near task, like reading. In
Parkinson’s, vergence eye movement can be impaired resulting in the person experiencing
double vision.
- Other eye problems that can make reading difficult include:
- Slowing of eye lid movement. This means less blinking which can cause dry or irritated eyes
or even blurring of vision.
- Spasms of the eyelid muscles can cause involuntary eye closure, called blepharospasm.
- Some medications used in Parkinson’s can cause dry eyes.
What can I try for myself?
For dry eyes, over-the-counter ointments and eye drops are available from pharmacists; they can
be very helpful.
What else may be helpful?
