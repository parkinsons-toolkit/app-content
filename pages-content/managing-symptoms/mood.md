# Low Mood

## What’s the difference between low mood and depression?

Everyone experiences low mood sometimes, often after a difficult event or even for no clear reason. For many, these feelings are manageable and pass gradually. For others, low mood may persist and impact daily life, making it harder to “shake off.” This may indicate depression. Depression affects physical health, appetite, and sleep, and being physically unwell can also lower mood.

A general low mood might involve feeling sad or emotionally “flat” or “empty.” Other possible feelings include:  
- Lack of self-confidence  
- Feeling worried or anxious  
- Feeling frustrated or irritable  
- Feeling tired or lacking energy  

Though common, these feelings don’t have to be accepted as inevitable. Small changes like talking about difficulties or improving sleep can help. Staying physically, mentally, and socially active also supports mood.

## Depression vs Low Mood

Depression is more intense and lasts longer than usual low mood. Symptoms of depression include:  
- Low, flat, or empty mood lasting 2 weeks or more  
- Loss of enjoyment in things you used to like  
- Feeling hopeless  
- Feeling tired or lacking energy  
- Difficulty concentrating on everyday tasks (e.g., watching TV)  
- Comfort eating or loss of appetite  
- Sleeping too much or difficulty sleeping  

Some people may feel “tired of life” without wanting to die, but severe depression can include thoughts of self-harm or suicide.

## Causes of Depression in Parkinson’s

Depression has no single cause. It results from brain and body changes, life experiences, and coping strategies. People with Parkinson’s may have had depression before or have family history of it. Brain chemical changes in Parkinson’s may contribute but don’t always cause depression directly.

Parkinson’s medications don’t cause depression, but mood may change when medications are adjusted. Mood ups and downs during the day are common and not always depression.

---

## Diagnosing Depression in Parkinson’s

Diagnosing depression can be tricky because symptoms overlap:  
- Sleep difficulties and fatigue are common in Parkinson’s but not always signs of depression.  
- Changes in facial expression can make someone appear sad even if they’re not.

Depression is common in people with multiple long-term health conditions, not just Parkinson’s, indicating that having any chronic illness is a major risk factor.

## What Should I Do About It?

Try self-help strategies (see below), but if low mood lasts most of the day, nearly every day, for over 2 weeks, see your GP. They can assess for depression and may suggest medication or talking therapies.

### Seek urgent help if you experience:  
- Great emotional distress  
- Repeated thoughts of death or suicide  
- Thoughts of self-harm or harming others  

If immediate risk is present, go to A&E or call 999 for an ambulance.

If you need urgent help but cannot go to A&E:  
- Call Samaritans on Freephone 116 123 (24/7)  
- Contact your GP for an emergency appointment  
- Call NHS 111 (England) or NHS Direct 0845 46 47 (Wales)  
- Contact your local crisis team if under their care  

For more info, see the charity Mind’s guidance on urgent mental health support.

## What Can I Try For Myself?

Many things may improve mood. Not all work for everyone, but all promote health and well-being.

### Activity  
Regular exercise can boost mood and improve sleep. Examples include:  
- Walking regularly  
- Gym sessions  
- Sports teams  
- Dance, yoga, or tai chi classes  

Small changes also help:  
- Tidying up faster  
- Using stairs instead of lifts  
- Leaving the car at home for short trips  
- Getting off the bus a stop early and walking  

If unsure about safe exercise, ask your GP or physiotherapist for advice.

### Diet  
A balanced diet affects physical and mental well-being. Depression can cause cravings for “junk food” high in sugar and salt, which may cause mood swings and feelings of guilt. Some may lose appetite and risk becoming underweight.

Limit alcohol intake as it can worsen mood and affect sleep quality.

See the Eating Well page for more advice.

### Social Activity & Combating Loneliness  
Depression often leads to social withdrawal, which can worsen mood. Staying connected with friends, family, and others with Parkinson’s helps by sharing experiences and coping strategies.

Look for local activities at colleges, places of worship, community centres, leisure facilities, charities, and societies. Local libraries can provide information on opportunities.

If you need travel support to attend events, see the Travel page for advice.

Visit the Social & Spiritual Life page for more on staying socially active.

# Sleep

Depression and anxiety can both affect the quality of our sleep. Similarly, when our sleep is disturbed by other things, it can negatively affect our mood. Improving your sleep is one of the best ways to manage low mood and depression. Here are some tips to improve the amount and quality of your sleep:  
- Have a strict bedtime routine, going to bed at the same time each night  
- Leave yourself time to wind down before bed (e.g., avoid electronic devices for at least an hour before bedtime as they may negatively affect sleep)  
- Try to relax before bed (e.g., reading, a warm bath, gentle music, relaxation or stretching exercises)  
- Write a “to do” list for the next day before bed to clear your mind of distractions  
- Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable  
- Avoid caffeine (e.g., tea and coffee) after 2pm  

See our Sleep Disturbance page for more tips on improving sleep quality.

# Relaxation and Breathing Exercises

Making time to relax is important. Try activities you find restful, such as listening to music, reading, walking, painting, or colouring. Visit the Mind charity website (linked in More Information) for tips on incorporating relaxation into daily life.

Calming breathing techniques can reduce stress and boost emotional well-being. See our Dealing with Stress & Challenges page for simple breathing exercises.

---

# Mindfulness

Mindfulness encourages focusing on the present moment—your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations, and surroundings. Regular practice can improve emotional wellbeing.

It is often part of psychological treatment and recommended by NICE to help prevent recurrent depression. Mindfulness groups and courses may be available locally. Visit the MIND website and NHS Mental Health & Wellbeing pages for more information and guidance on incorporating mindfulness daily. Links are in More Information below.

# Keep a Gratitude Diary

Writing about things you’re grateful for may lift your mood and improve mental wellbeing. Aim to describe one thing you’re grateful for twice a week. This can be anything that makes you feel grateful, big or small.

**Tips for keeping a gratitude diary:**  
- Take time to think about something you truly appreciate  
- Writing about people tends to have a stronger positive effect than things or events  
- Include as much detail as possible about why you’re grateful  
- Plan a regular time to write, and consider setting a phone alarm to remind you

# Complementary Therapies

Complementary therapies like massage, acupuncture, and aromatherapy may promote relaxation and wellbeing. Though not clinically proven to treat depression, some people with Parkinson’s find them helpful.

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse before using anything by mouth or on your skin.

See our Complementary Therapy page for more details.

---

# Resources for Wellbeing and Mental Health

There are many apps designed to support wellbeing and specific mental health needs. Most are not clinically tested. If interested, explore the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.

Books can also help. The Reading Well Books on Prescription website offers recommendations, many available via your local library. See More Information below for links.

---

# Self-Help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)

CBT focuses on how feelings, thoughts, and behaviour influence each other, potentially causing or worsening depression. There are NHS-recommended self-help CBT books for depression, accessible through local libraries via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme.

For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse, or visit the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.

# My Experience

> “Sometimes I do have a good old moan and I do have a bit of a cry, because I feel so frustrated when I can’t do what I want to do. But then I just have to pick myself up and get going again.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*

> “I can have a bad day, I can have days when my mood swings are not very happy because I don’t feel very well. When I’m not well, I’m obviously not happy. That’s why watching a film sometimes helps because you’re into the film. And you can ignore the fact of how you’re probably feeling. I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*

# Further Assessment

## Questions to Consider

Healthcare professionals may ask:  
- How often are you affected by low mood and how long does it last?  
- How is low mood affecting your life?  
- Are you no longer enjoying things you used to?  
- Are you feeling hopeless?  
- Are you tired or lacking energy?  
- Do you have difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g., watching TV)?  
- Are you comfort eating or losing your appetite?  
- Are you sleeping more than usual or unable to sleep?  
- Do you have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm?  
- Do you sometimes see or hear things that aren’t really there? Any other unusual experiences?

## Symptom and Activity Tracker

Tracking symptoms can help recall details and identify patterns. If mood fluctuates, track it over 2-3 days to see when it worsens. Record sleep patterns if variable, note factors affecting mood, and medication times to identify relationships.

## Tests

Your healthcare professional may perform examinations or blood/urine tests to check for other causes of depression, such as thyroid issues or blood imbalances.

---

# Further Treatments

Your healthcare professional can give specific self-help advice, refer you to other services, or discuss medication.

## Referral

- Typically for talking therapies or mental health teams.  
- Your GP or specialist can refer you.  
- In England, you can self-refer for talking therapies via [NHS Psychological Therapies Service](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/).  
- There may be long waiting times for NHS therapy.

Talking therapies provide a safe, confidential place to discuss difficulties with a trained professional. Sessions may be one-to-one or in small groups. Various types exist but all aim to improve wellbeing.

See additional information on talking therapies for details.

# Complementary Therapies  
Complementary therapies include massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. These therapies have not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them. These therapies may not directly treat the depression but can be helpful for relaxation and general wellbeing.  

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if you wish to take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a complementary therapy.  

See our Complementary Therapy page for more information.  

# Resources for Wellbeing and Mental Health  
There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. Most of them have not been tested. If you want to try one, look at the mental health apps and tools in the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.  

There are also many books that might be helpful. The Reading Well Books on Prescription website has some ideas. Many of these books will be available through your local library. You can find the link in our More Information section below.  

# Self-help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of depression (see ‘Further Treatments’ for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by the NHS for people with depression. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.  

# My Experience  
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.  

> “Sometimes I do have a good old moan and I do have a bit of a cry, because I feel so frustrated when I can’t do what I want to do. But then I just have to pick myself up and get going again.” (Person with Parkinson’s)  

> “I can have a bad day, I can have days when my mood swings are not very happy because I don’t feel very well. When I’m not well, I’m obviously not happy. That’s why watching a film sometimes helps because you’re into the film. And you can ignore the fact of how you’re probably feeling. I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.” (Person with Parkinson’s)  

# Further Assessment  

### Questions  
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.  
- See extra information below about things they might ask about with regard to mood.  

  - How often you are affected by low mood and how long does it last?  
  - How is low mood affecting your life?  
  - Are you no longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to?  
  - Are you feeling hopeless?  
  - Are you feeling tired or lacking energy?  
  - Are you having difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)?  
  - Are you comfort eating or losing your appetite?  
  - Are you sleeping more than usual or unable to sleep?  
  - Are you having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm?  
  - Do you sometimes see or hear things that are not really there? Do you have any other unusual experiences?  

### Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker  
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.  
- If your mood fluctuates during the day, track it over 2-3 days to see when it bothers you most. You could also record your sleep patterns if these vary. You could note any factors that you think may be related (i.e. things that seem to make your mood worse and things that seem to help). Also record when you take your medication as there may be a relationship.  

### Tests  
Depending on their assessment, your healthcare professional may wish to examine you and carry out blood or urine tests. Such tests are used to look for other causes of depression, such as thyroid conditions or imbalances in the blood (e.g. high calcium levels).  

# Further Treatments  
Your healthcare professional may be able to give you more specific advice about things you could try yourself. They might also refer you on to another service or discuss the option of medication.  

### Referral  
- Referral would typically be for talking therapies or to mental health teams. Your GP can refer you, and it may also be available through your specialist team. In England you can also self-refer for talking therapies without going through your GP through https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/. There can be a long wait to start therapy on the NHS.  
- Talking therapies offer a safe, confidential place to talk to a trained professional about any difficulties you are having.  
  - Therapy sessions can be one-to-one with the therapist or in small groups.  
  - There is lots of different types of talking therapies, but they all have the same aim of improving your wellbeing. See extra information below about talking therapies.  

  - **Counselling:** Counselling can help you cope with mild versions of common mental health problems, including depression. It might also help you to talk about a specific event or cause for your low mood, such as relationship difficulties or a bereavement. Counselling may be available on the NHS. It can also be available for free through your employer. Some charities offer cheap or free talking therapies or group support. This includes Cruse for bereavement care, Relate for relationship counselling and Mind. Some private counsellors also offer discounted rates for those on low incomes. See our More information section for details on how to find a trained and accredited therapist.  

  - **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT):** CBT aims to help you understand how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour influence each other. Your therapist will aim to teach you skills in identifying and overcoming ‘unhelpful’ or negative thoughts to help you cope better and reduce symptoms of depression. CBT typically involves a course of weekly sessions and may be delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or specially trained nurse. For people with milder depression, treatment can be done via computer from your own home with support from a mental health care professional. CBT for depression will include looking to help associated problems such as sleep, lack of physical activity, and social isolation. CBT is available on the NHS by self-referral or through your GP.  

  - **Other therapies:** While CBT is the most commonly offered therapy, other therapies might also be available and recommended. A wide range of other therapies exist. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) has an A-Z of therapies, which explains what they are. You can talk to your GP or NHS psychological therapy service about other types of therapy available in your area.  

# Medication  
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.  
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.  
- See extra information below about medication used for low mood.  

  - **Antidepressants:** For moderate to severe depression, antidepressant medication may be prescribed alone or recommended in combination with talking therapy. ‘Combination Therapy’ of antidepressant medication with talking therapy can result in better outcomes than just receiving one of these treatments. Research has not yet identified a specific type of anti-depressant to recommend specifically for people with Parkinson’s. There is some evidence for tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline. There is limited evidence for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram or sertraline in Parkinson’s specifically. There is good evidence however that they can work for moderate or severe depression in the general population. While some antidepressants work very well for some people they have no effect for others. Usually, a person is tried on one medicine at increasing doses for several weeks to see if it helps. If it does not, then the drug should be slowly withdrawn and a different drug tried. Anti-depressants are not addictive but they should not be stopped suddenly. If none of the main drugs seem to help, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further advice. You can read more about different anti-depressant drugs and potential side effects here.  

  - **Parkinson’s medicines:** There is some research evidence for the dopamine agonist pramipexole, but the effects are modest. Other Parkinson’s drugs have no obvious antidepressant effect.  

  - **St John’s wort:** St John’s wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for mild-moderate depression. It is not recommended by doctors and should never be combined with prescribed antidepressants. In particular, it should not be taken by people with Parkinson’s as it can interact with a lot of medication, including Parkinson’s medication. It is important you let your healthcare professionals know if you are taking this.  

- Some medication can make your mood worse. See extra information below about some of these medicines. If you are depressed and taking any of these you should not stop them without speaking with your GP for advice.  

  - Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam  
  - Pain killers: opiates  
  - Steroid medication, e.g. prednisolone  
  - Beta blockers, e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol  
  - Hormonal medicine, e.g. some Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) used for menopausal symptoms or hormonal contraceptive medicines.  

# Key Messages  
- Low mood is common and there are many things that you can do to prevent or help it.  
- Depression is more intense and longer lasting than the short periods of low mood that anyone can have from time to time.  
- Things you can do to improve your mood, even if you are not depressed: keep physically and socially active; maintain a healthy diet; improve sleep; and make time to relax.  
- There is a wide range of possible treatments for depression. Those offered by healthcare professionals include talking therapies and medication.

# Anxiety

Anxiety is the feeling of worry or fear, including a general sense of unease. This feeling can range in intensity from mild to severe.

Everyone can experience feelings of anxiety at some time in their life. Anxiety is a natural response to situations that we find stressful or threatening. For example, this might be about your health, moving house or work-related problems. It may subside once the situation changes or the person becomes used to the situation. But sometimes feelings of anxiety can last for long periods of time and without a clear cause. This can be troubling for the person and can affect their day-to-day life.

## Common symptoms of anxiety

There are a range of symptoms experienced with anxiety which varies from person to person. Listed below are some of the more common features:

| Body Sensations                        | Thoughts & Feelings                         | Changes in Behaviour                               |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| • Muscle pain or tension              | • A sense of dread                          | • Repeated checking or seeking reassurance        |
| • Heart beating fast, or palpitations| • Constant worry                           | • Avoiding situations or places that are associated with stress or anxiety |

The body sensations are the physical response to stress and threat. However, the same sensations can be caused by a number of acute and long-term physical health conditions including Parkinson’s.  
They can also be a side effect of some medications. If someone is experiencing the body sensations without the thoughts and feelings or changes in behaviour, they are unlikely to be anxious.

Worry is one of the most common features of anxiety in people with Parkinson’s. Some worry is normal. Indeed, a bit of worry can be useful as it forces us to think ahead and plan for stressful events. But worry can become excessive, taking up much of our time as well as our emotional energy. Such worry is often unproductive – it does not lead to solutions to problems. Instead, it traps us in a cycle of ‘what-ifs’ and expecting the worse. While we can sometimes distract ourselves from such worry, it tends to come back – often when we are trying to sleep.

Anxiety also changes our behaviour; we look for ways to reduce unpleasant body sensations and distressing thoughts and feelings. For example, we might be repeatedly check we have done something or ask for reassurance from others. These behaviours can give short-term relief, but they do not break the cycle. The most common behaviour change in anxiety is avoidance. Once we work out what we are afraid of, it makes sense to avoid it. This is OK sometimes. However, it becomes a problem if it leads to us avoiding going out of the house, using public transport or socialising. Although avoidance can lead to a short-term reduction in anxiety, it makes whatever we are avoiding even more frightening.

## What sorts of things are people with Parkinson’s anxious about?

Uncertainty about the future can be difficult and can cause anxiety and worry. This might be particularly the case with health conditions that have an unpredictable course, such as Parkinson’s.

Some people are generally anxious about any stressful and potentially threatening situation. For others, it is more specific. For example, they may feel very anxious in social situations or in crowded places with lots of strangers around. People will often feel anxious before and during such situations. In a few people, the anxiety may increase very suddenly – a so-called ‘panic attack’. These can be very distressing. A person will often avoid situations where they have had a panic attack in the past.

## What might be causing it?

Anxiety can be caused by a combination of factors. Such factors include imbalances in brain chemicals, genetics, and stressful life events. People who have been anxious throughout their life may find that their anxiety has got worse since their Parkinson’s started. This may be due to the brain changes, or because Parkinson’s increases the number of ‘threats’ faced day-to-day. In other words, they may have more to be anxious about.

Some symptoms of Parkinson’s can cause anxiety or make it worse. For example, after a fall or loss of balance, you may develop a fear of falling. See the Balance and Falls page for guidance on this.

Some people experience anxiety when their medication is wearing off. This improves once they take their next dose of medication. You can also feel anxious if your medication is wearing off and you experience difficulties moving. You may find that when your movement symptoms are better controlled by medication, your levels of anxiety reduce.

Alcohol, caffeine, and some illicit drugs can make anxiety worse. Withdrawing from a substance or medication can also increase anxiety levels. Hormonal imbalances, such as high thyroid hormone levels, are another possible cause of anxiety.

## What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try to help you deal with anxiety (see ‘What can I try for myself?’). If anxiety is having a big impact on your life, you should speak to a healthcare professional. In some cases, anxiety has a negative impact on other symptoms of Parkinson’s. For example, stress and anxiety can make tremor worse, interfere with walking, and increase the risk of falls. Seeking support early can give you more control and help you manage feelings of anxiety.

Anxiety and depression often occur at the same time, and anxiety can make depression even more difficult to live with. You should seek urgent professional help if you are feeling great emotional distress or are experiencing feelings that are difficult to manage. These can include thoughts of death, suicidal ideas, thoughts of self-harm, panic attacks, flashbacks, and paranoia or hearing voices. You should speak to your GP in the first instance or go to A&E if not available and you are experiencing these. You can normally get an emergency appointment through your GP practice for urgent mental health concerns.

If you need immediate help but don’t want to see your GP or go to A&E, you could:  
• Call Samaritans on Freephone 116 123. They're open 24 hours a day and are there to listen  
• Contact NHS 111 (England) or NHS Direct 0845 46 47 (Wales)  
• If you are under the care of a local crisis team, contact them  

For more details, the charity Mind has information about how to seek urgent mental health support.

## What can I try for myself?

There are many things you can try to help manage and reduce anxiety. These include:

### Activity

Being more active can help to combat stress and reduce anxiety. You may choose to do this by going to the gym or going to classes e.g. dance, yoga, or tai chi. But achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as making small changes to your everyday routines. For example:  
• Tidy up a bit faster when doing the housework  
• Extending walks to the shops/other errands a bit further, or going more often  
• Use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator  
• Leave the car at home for short journeys  
• Get off the bus a stop earlier and walking the rest of the journey  
See Keeping Active pages for more guidance.

If you have any concerns about safe and suitable exercise routines, discuss with your GP or a physiotherapist who will be able to recommend exercise that is right for you.

### Diet

Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone. The food we eat can affect the way we feel, both physically and mentally, and how we feel can affect the food we eat. Anxiety can make you feel nauseous, or reduce your appetite, and it is important to still eat healthily if it is affecting you in this way. Some people ‘comfort eat’ when they feel anxious, for example extra sugary foods, which might lead to feeling guilty and increasing anxiety further.

It can help to cut down on the amount of caffeine (found in tea, coffee, and some fizzy drinks) and alcohol you drink. This is because these can make some symptoms of anxiety (e.g. heart racing) worse.

Healthy eating habits can play an important role in improving our mood and general sense of well-being. See Eating Well for more guidance.

### Keep socially active

Sharing any worries or fears you may have with a friend or family member may help to reduce anxiety levels. Talking to others with Parkinson’s can also help by sharing your experiences and learning about different coping mechanisms or solutions to similar problems.

You can look out for new opportunities from activities offered through local colleges, churches, leisure facilities, charities, and societies. You can search for activities and groups in your area on the government website gov.uk. Your local library can also be a good source of information about what is available in your area. If you need support with travelling to events, see our Travel page for advice.

Visit our Social & Spiritual Life & Spiritual page for more information on how you can keep socially active.

### Sleep

Many people with anxiety or worry may find it difficult getting to sleep. Our sleep page has some information on this and what you can try to help.

### Relaxation

It’s important to try and make time to relax. Try doing things you find restful. This might be listening to music, reading a book, going for a walk, or getting creative by painting or colouring.

See the Mind charity website for more tips on how to incorporate relaxation into your daily life. They also have example relaxation exercises you can try.

### Breathing strategies

Calming breathing exercises can help to reduce anxiety. When you feel anxious, you are more likely to take rapid, shallow breaths. This can cause sensations such as increased heart rate, dizziness, and muscle tension. In turn, this can increase feelings of anxiety. So, doing simple breathing exercises can help you to relax and reduce anxiety levels. These exercises work best when they’re practised regularly. You can even make them part of your daily routine (e.g. doing some deep breathing while waiting for the kettle to boil).

Here’s an example of a simple breathing exercise you can try:  
• Get into a position that you find comfortable (this can be standing, sitting, lying, etc.).  
• Try to keep your shoulders down and relaxed and place your hand on your stomach.  
• Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach rise as you breathe in and fall as you breathe out.  
• You may find it helpful to count steadily as you breathe: ‘one, two, three, four, five’ as you breathe in and ‘one, two, three, four, five’ as you breathe out. Try to work out what feels comfortable for you.  
• Repeat for 3-5 minutes.

### Mindfulness

Mindfulness encourages you to pay closer attention to the present moment, focusing on your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and your environment. By doing this regularly it can help to improve your general emotional well-being.

Mindfulness is often included as part of psychological treatment. It encourages you to notice any stress or anxiety you might be feeling and can help you to deal with this better. Visit the NHS Mental Health & Wellbeing pages for more information on how mindfulness can help our mental well-being. You can find the link in our More Information section below. It also gives guidance on how we can incorporate mindfulness into our day-to-day lives.

### Complementary therapies

Complementary therapies include massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. These therapies have not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them. These therapies may not directly treat the anxiety but can be helpful for relaxation and general well-being.

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if you wish to take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a complementary therapy.

See our Complementary Therapy page for more information.

## Resources for wellbeing and mental health

There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. If you want to try one, look at the mental health apps and tools in the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.

Here is a selection of self-help leaflets available online that might be helpful. You can find these in our More Information section. Alternatively, there are some books (e.g., ‘The worry cure’ By Robert Leahy). The Reading Well Books on Prescription web page has some other suggestions. Many of these books will be available through your local library or available to buy from local bookstores or online.

Some books are available in audiobook format, if preferred.

There are also some websites that have a wide range of advice and resources groups. You can pay to become a member of these groups, if you wish. See the More Information section.

### Self-help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of anxiety (see ‘Further Treatments’ for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by the NHS for people with anxiety. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.

### Worry management

There are some simple tricks that we can use to take back control of our repetitive unproductive worry.

• ‘Worry time’: worry thoughts can happen at any time. The thing we are worrying about may be important so we feel that deserves our attention. However, it can get in the way of other things. One simple trick is to plan one or two short periods of ‘worry time’ during the day. These are the times that you allow yourself to worry. Because you know that you can come back to the worry later, it is easier to switch it off at the time it pops into your head. Interestingly, when your scheduled worry time comes along, the worry often does not seem so worrying.
