# Symptom Management

will look and feel in the future is one of the more difficult aspects of the Parkinson’s
diagnosis. Symptoms tend to progress over time, but progression does not mean tomorrow.
While the symptoms discussed here can all be associated with Parkinson’s, they can also be for
other reasons. A new symptom is not always the result of Parkinson’s. It can be tricky for people
with Parkinson’s, as well as for healthcare professionals, to know which symptoms are due to
Parkinson’s and which are not.
A couple of general patterns that are not rules:

- Parkinson’s symptoms tend to develop slowly. If a new symptom has come on very suddenly
  (e.g. over minutes or hours), it is not likely to be a new Parkinson’s symptom, unless it is in
  response to a medication. But, people do find that over time their symptoms can become
  more abrupt. For example, a person’s movements might suddenly ‘stop’. If a new symptom
  occurs suddenly, an assessment by a healthcare professional can help to find the underlying
  cause.
- Symptoms can change in relation to Parkinson’s medication. This is most clear for movement
  symptoms, but also applies to symptoms like pain and fatigue. There are many possible causes
  for pain and fatigue, but if these get worse towards the end of a dosing interval and get better
  after taking medications, then they are more likely to be due to Parkinson’s.
  You can use My Tracker (found in your manual) to track your symptoms over time, as well as track
  them in relation to medication or meals. This can help to identify whether symptoms are due to
  Parkinson’s or not.
  The following pages give guidance for things you can try to help your symptoms, but they are not
  a replacement for healthcare professionals. If you have a new or severe symptom, you should still
  seek professional advice.

  Urinary Symptoms
  Urinary symptoms are common in Parkinson’s. There are also many other conditions that affect
  the urinary tract, so not all urinary symptoms are due to the Parkinson’s.
  Common symptoms:
- Urinary frequency - This is needing to go to the toilet to pass urine more often than usual.
- Urinary urgency – This is having sudden overwhelming urges to pass urine, with difficulty
  holding on.
- Urinary retention – This is an inability to empty the bladder.
- Urinary incontinence – This is accidental or involuntary leakage of urine. This could be wetting
  the bed without being aware or able to stop. It can be a urinary symptom itself, or may occur
  if getting to the toilet is difficult. It can occur with urinary urgency, particularly if you can’t
  access a toilet in time.
- Stress incontinence - Some people, particularly women who have had children, can
  experience a leakage of urine if they e.g. laugh, cough, sneeze or exercise. This is usually due
  to weakened pelvic floor muscles and is not related to Parkinson’s.
- Nocturia – This is needing to pass urine more than twice during the night (Once or twice is
  considered normal).
  What might be causing it?
  Parkinson’s can cause most of the symptoms listed above. It does not however cause pain on
  passing urine, blood in the urine. However, urinary symptoms are not always due to Parkinson’s.
  Other causes of urinary symptoms include:
- Urinary tract infections (UTIs) – often presents as pain or burning on passing urine.
  Sometimes you can have high temperatures or hot & cold shivery flushes. It can also cause
  pain in the lower tummy, and sometimes blood is temporarily seen in the urine. In more
  severe cases UTIs can trigger “delirium” which can make people appear confused.
- Enlarged prostate – this is only for men –and often causes a gradual worsening of urinary
  symptoms. This usually presents as a weak flow of urine, difficulty starting flow, or dribbling
  at the end of the flow.
- Medications - in particular diuretic medications (water tablets), e.g. furosemide.
- Constipation – not completely emptying the bowels can put pressure on the urinary tract so
  reduce flow of urine.
- Diabetes – generally associated with excessive thirst and drinking. More likely if there is
  diabetes in the family. There are different types of diabetes which show different patterns.
- Prolapse or weakened pelvic floor– this is where some of the pelvic organs are not being
  adequately supported by the muscles of the pelvis. This may be felt as a dull pain or a sense
  of “dragging” down below. It may cause stress incontinence symptoms, and
  make incontinence worse. It particularly affects women after the menopause, who have been
  through childbirth, people who have had pelvic surgery, and people who are overweight.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself as below, but there are some circumstances where you
  should seek professional help:

1. If you are very ill with new urinary symptoms, if you have a fever and shivery bouts or backache, if
   there is lots of blood in your urine, or you are confused or drowsy then you should contact your GP
   straight away, call 111 or go to A&E.
2. You should contact your GP as soon as possible if you have any of the following:

- Blood in urine
- Pain on passing urine or pain in your tummy
- Thirsty all the time
- Passing urine more frequently
- Have new urinary incontinence

3. You should see your GP routinely if you have any of the following:

- Poor flow of urine for men
- Feeling of dragging down below
- Stress incontinence – leakage when you e.g., laugh or cough

What can I try for myself?

Fluid intake

- Reduce/avoid caffeinated drinks – as these can make urinary symptoms worse. You may find
  that there is a particular time that is a problem – e.g. if you have caffeine in the evening, then

night-time symptoms are worse.

- Reduce/avoid alcohol intake – alcohol can make
  urinary symptoms worse.

- Reduce/avoid fizzy drinks – these can make urinary
  symptoms worse.
- Adjust your fluid intake – if night-time symptoms are
  bad, you could reduce the volume of fluid you consume in
  the hour or two before bed.
- Stay hydrated – while it might be tempting to drink less in the hope of needing the toilet less,
  having concentrated urine sitting in the bladder for a long time makes you prone to infections
  and concentrated urine can irritate the bladder. So keep hydrated.
  Tracking your symptoms may help you identify particular triggers for your urinary symptoms (see
  section “Further Assessment”).
  Toileting advice
- Try to get into a routine.
- Try to allow time to get to the toilet, and allow enough time to empty fully your bladder.
- Lighting and arrangement of furniture are environmental considerations, which affect getting to
  the toilet at night.
  Pelvic floor exercises
  Weakness in the pelvic floor can contribute to incontinence so strengthening the muscles of the
  pelvic floor can improve symptoms. Like any exercises, they require motivation and persistence.
  You have to keep them up to keep the pelvic floor strong. These exercises are particularly effective
  if there is stress incontinence. The exercises have been shown to help for other bladder symptoms
  too.
  If the problem is due to Parkinson’s, pelvic floor exercises will not fix it, but it may help. See More
  Information below for more detailed advice.
  Weight loss
  If you are overweight then there is more pressure on your bladder and pelvic floor. In this case
  losing weight can improve urinary symptoms. However, if you are normal or underweight we do
  not advise trying to lose weight.
  Bladder retraining
  This is a technique whereby you slowly build up bladder control. This is by making yourself hold a
  full bladder a little bit longer each time you need to go to the toilet. It is generally used for
  symptoms of urgency, or incontinence due to urgency (known as urge incontinence). If the
  problem is due to Parkinson’s, bladder retraining will not fix it, but it may help. See More
  Information below for more detailed advice.
  Finding toilets
  If finding toilets when out and about is a concern, the ‘National Key
  Scheme’ may help. This system allows people with a disability to unlock
  more than 9,000 accessible public toilets across the UK. See the
  Disability Rights UK website for more information and to buy a ‘Radar Key’, and see list for your
  region.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I did have a problem with my bladder where, at night-time I was getting up 10, 11, 12
times in the night for a wee. And when I spoke to my doctor about it, she suggested that I
cut down liquids or drinks from 6pm onwards. And that works. If I want a
sip of water, I’ll have just a sip of water” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Further assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section in your manual to bring to the
  appointment.
  See extra information below for things they might ask about with regard to urinary symptoms.
- Nature of the symptoms: as listed in the introduction above.
- Presence of other symptoms: pain on passing urine, blood in the urine, tummy pain, fevers
  (high temperatures), flow of urine, bowel function, feeling thirsty, unintentional weight loss.
- Patterns of the symptom: timing over the course of a day or at night, triggers.
- Lifestyle: what and when you drink; alcohol intake.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker (in your manual)
- This can help you to recall the details and help the health professional identify patterns.
- For urinary symptoms you could monitor:
- When you pass urine and any problems you experience when doing so.
- If urgency is a problem, and you want to try bladder retraining, it is helpful to record how long you
  waited between feeling the urge and actually passing urine.
- Fluid intake – what type of drink and roughly how much (e.g. medium glass of water, a cup of
  coffee)
- Monitoring for 3 days would normally be adequate.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, they may do further tests such as:
- Examination: The doctor may ask to do a pelvic examination (women) to check for e.g. prolapse, or
  a rectal examination (men) to check the size of your prostate.
- Urine sample tests: some information can be gained from a “dipstick” test (results in a matter of
  minutes), or they may send your urine off for testing in the lab (results take several days).
- Blood tests: to check kidney function and can give an indication of the body fighting infection.
- Scans of the urinary tract: Most common scans are Ultrasound or CT scans, but depends on the
  symptoms.
  Further treatments
  Having consulted a healthcare professional, they may offer reassurance or advice for your
  particular problems, or possibly a further treatment.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some specialist nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses)
  may change your medication if within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
  See extra information below to see about some medications used to stabilise the bladder.
- For urinary urgency (sudden overwhelming urges to pass urine, with difficulty holding on)
  The first choice medication according to NICE guidelines are “anticholinergic medications”
  , such as tolterodine and solifenacin. Whilst effective, side effects are not uncommon
  particularly in the elderly, so it is best to have tried lifestyle changes first.
- In cases where 2 anticholinergic medications have not worked, a medication called
  ‘Mirabegron’ may be tried.
  See extra information below about some medications that may worsen urinary symptoms.
- Diuretics (e.g. furosemide, bumetanide, bendroflumethiazide)
- Muscle relaxants and sedatives (e.g. diazepam)
- Narcotics (e.g. morphine, oxycodone)
- Antihistamines (e.g. chlorpheniramine)
- Alpha blockers (e.g. doxazosin)
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service.
- Please be aware there is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you.
  See extra information below about typical referrals for urinary problems.
- Urology – in some cases if a urinary tract or prostate condition is suspected.
- Gynaecology – if pelvic problems in women are suspected.
- Geriatric Medicine – if there are complex issues related to multiple aspects of your health.
- Community Bladder & Bowel or Continence Services – they can make a detailed assessment
  of the problem and help with things like bladder retraining and getting pads and other
  toileting aids.
- Occasionally, specialist neurology services, if persistent difficult to manage urinary symptoms
  resulting from the Parkinson’s.
- Supportive services: Occupational Therapy, Physiotherapy/ Gynaecological physiotherapy,
  District Nurses.
  Key messages
- Stay hydrated, but think about what and when you are drinking.

  Bowel Symptoms
  Everyone has a different natural bowel pattern, so bowel symptoms are different for each person.
  Constipation, or reduced bowel motions, is common in Parkinson’s. You may experience:

* Difficulty passing a bowel movement (straining)
* Hard or lumpy stools
* Opening bowels less often. If you are having less than 3 bowel movements per week, it is likely
  you are constipated
* A feeling that you haven’t fully emptied your bowel
* Feeling of blockage in the bottom or having to use fingers to remove stool during a bowel
  movement.
  Constipation can make you feel very unwell and, if left untreated, can become serious.
  Constipation can affect the absorption of medications and, if severe, may cause vomiting. Both of
  these can make your medication less effective.
  Constipation can sometimes lead to diarrhoea or leaking of stool. Hard stool gets stuck and only
  the liquid content comes out. So, although it can seem like diarrhoea, the bowels are very
  constipated and blocked up. This is known as “overflow diarrhoea” and the best approach to
  resolve it is to treat the constipation.
  What might be causing it?
  In Parkinson’s, constipation is common due to slowing down of the bowel contractions. Diet,
  medications, and activity levels also have a big impact on the bowels and can cause constipation.
  Constipation can be a symptom of other medical conditions so a healthcare professional may ask
  questions to check for these.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself (see ‘What can I try for myself’), but there are some
  circumstances where you should seek professional help. If you are in severe pain or passing a lot
  of blood in the stools you should contact your GP to be seen urgently or go to A&E.
  See your GP if you have had any of the following:
* Bleeding from the back passage
* Abdominal or anal pain
* Diarrhoea following a period of constipation (see above)
* Significant change in your bowel habit that lasts 4 weeks or more
* Unintentional significant weight loss (see weight loss page)
* New bowel incontinence
* If you have tried the suggestions listed in ‘What can I try for myself?’ and the problem persists
  after a month.
  What can I try for myself?
  Diet & hydration
  Fibre in your diet helps improve constipation. Eat a variety of fibres.
  Fibre is in:
* Wholegrain - many breakfast cereals, whole-wheat pasta, wholegrain bread and oats, barley and rye.
* Fruit
* Vegetables
* Peas, beans, pulses, nuts, seeds
  How much fibre? Aim for 30 g spread throughout the day. If you are not meeting this then
  gradually increase fibre intake to reach this. You can find more information of fibre content in
  food through the links in our more information section.
  Dehydration contributes to constipation, and fluids are needed to treat dehydration. But, if you
  are not dehydrated, then just drinking extra fluid will not resolve the constipation. Alcoholic drinks
  are not good for hydration, as they make you urinate more.
  How much fluid? In general, 1.5-2L of fluid (8-10 cups or medium glasses) per day is advised. You
  will need more if it is hot or you are exerting more energy. People stop feeling thirsty before the
  body is completely rehydrated so you should drink even if you are not thirsty. You can also lose
  your sense of thirst a bit when you get older. The colour of urine is a good indicator of hydration;
  if you are drinking enough your urine should be a straw or pale yellow colour.
  Tips on drinking enough: It is difficult to
  drink this much
  fluid for some people. You could try drinking a small glass
  of water each time you take your medication and a glass
  of water or a drink e.g. cup of tea with each meal. All sorts
  of fluid count towards your daily amount, it doesn’t have to
  be just water. Fruit juices, squash, hot drinks (e.g. tea,
  coffee), milk and low alcohol beer all count. Remember you can also have fluid in your food which counts
  too, such as milk in cereal or soups.
  Caution: if you have been advised to limit your fluid intake for another health reason (e.g. heart
  or kidney disease), then speak to your healthcare professional first.
  Certain fruits help draw water into the bowel to soften the stool. Increasing intake of these helps
  constipation:
* Apples
* Apricots
* Avocado
* Kiwi fruit
* Peaches
* Pears
* Plums
* Prunes
  Activity
  Being physically active improves the movement of the bowels. If you can, try going for a walk
  every day. See Keeping Active for advice on how to achieve this.
  Toileting advice
* Getting into a routine helps.
* Allow adequate time.
* Position affects ease of bowel opening. Try raising your feet up on a stool when sat on a toilet
  as this can ease bowel opening. If possible, the best position is with your knees higher than
  your hips.
* Avoid resisting the urge to go to the toilet as this can cause constipation.
* There is not suitable evidence to recommend “abdominal massage” as a technique for treating
  constipation.
  Over-the-counter medications
  Caution: if you have severe pain or known bowel disease (such as Crohn’s Disease or
  Ulcerative
  Colitis) then you should speak to your pharmacist, GP or specialist before taking these.
  Probiotics & prebiotics
  Lots of bacteria live in your bowels as part of the normal gut
  environment, introduced through the food you eat.
  These supplements change the mix of bacteria in your bowel:
* Probiotics are living bacteria
* Prebiotics are fibre that acts a bit like a fertilizer for the bacteria
  living in the bowel.
  There is limited research in this area, complicated by the wide variety
  of strains available. There has been some research that showed a
  combination of pro- and prebiotics improved constipation in people
  with Parkinson’s.
  Fibre supplements
  If you have not got enough fibre in your diet, supplementation may be considered. The widely available
  fibre supplement is psyllium husk, or ispaghula husk – the ingredient of the laxative Fybogel.
  Laxatives
  Many people with Parkinson’s need to take laxatives on a regular and long-term basis to keep the
  bowels opening regularly. Laxatives only work if you are adequately hydrated. Laxatives are
  available from chemists and come in different types:
* Bulk-forming laxatives contain fibre and increase the bulk of the stool. This, in turn, stimulates
  the bowel. They can take a few days to work. Example: Fybogel.
* Osmotic laxatives draw water into the bowel to soften the stool. They can take a few days to
  work. Examples: Lactulose, movicol, and macrogol.
* Stool softener laxatives encourage water into the stool to soften it. Examples: sodium docusate
  and arachis oil.
* Stimulant laxatives stimulate the bowel to move the stool along. They take about 6-12 hours to
  work and can become less effective if used for a prolonged period of time. Examples: senna
  (senokot) and bisacodyl (Dulcolax).
  Side effects of laxatives
  The most common side effects are bloating, cramping or nausea. These
  often settle or may be improved by taking a smaller amount of the laxative. Overuse of laxatives
  can cause dehydration.
  Which to choose?
  Research has shown that Macrogol is likely to be effective in Parkinson’s and is safe. If one type of
  laxative is not effective, another type could be added in as well. Generally, osmotic or bulk-forming
  laxatives are advised first, while stimulant laxatives are a later choice.
  Finding toilets
  If finding toilets when out and about is a concern, the ‘National Key Scheme’ may help. This system
  allows people with a disability to unlock more than 9,000 accessible public toilets across the UK.
  For more information, see the Disability Rights UK website. You can use this website to buy a
  ‘Radar Key’ and/or Radar Key Region List.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“The shaking upsets my bowels and my bladder which is, you can imagine…Sometimes I go
into the toilet taking with me magazines and settle down.” (Person with Parkinsons, P17)
Further assessment
If the suggested strategies are not working, then consult your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. You
may wish to consider the following to help you to prepare for the appointment.
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about
  these in advance. Record this in your “My Health” section to print for the
  appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about. o Full detail of your
  bowel pattern now and in the past o Whether you have passed any blood or noticed a
  colour change of the stool o Whether you have pain o Whether you have
  unintentionally lost weight o Whether you have nausea or vomiting
- Whether you have any urinary symptoms, such as having to urinate more
  often o What your diet and lifestyle more broadly are like o Whether your diet
  or activity levels have changed recently
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker (in your manual)
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- Try to monitor constipation for about a week. The details that are helpful to record include:
- Bowel movements. Detail can be helpful: small/medium/large, hard/soft/watery.
  The Bristol Stool Chart is the chart used by professionals to describe the stool (see More
  Information).
- Your food and fluid intake.
  Tests
- Depending on their assessment, there is a small chance the healthcare professional will arrange
  further tests.
- This may include a stool sample, blood tests, a scan such as an X-Ray or CT scan, or an endoscopy. An
  endoscopy is where a camera is used to look inside the gut. It may be via the anus (known as a
  colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) to look at the lower part of the gut.
  Further Treatments
  A healthcare professional may be able to give more personalised advice about things you could try
  yourself.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may
  change your medication.
- Please do not make changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare
  professional.
- Some laxatives require a prescription.
- Some laxatives are given via the bottom, which can be tricky to do yourself, so may require a
  community nurse to come to the home to administer it. These are more likely in severe constipation
  or overflow diarrhoea.
- See extra information below about some medications that may contribute to constipation.
- Pain killers (e.g. codeine, morphine, gabapentin)
- Anticholinergic medications (e.g. atropine, trihexyphenidyl, oxybutynin,
  solifenacin) o Some anti-sickness medications (e.g. ondansetron) o Some
  medications used for pain or sleep (tricyclic antidepressants, such as
  amitriptyline) o Some heart/blood pressure medications (calcium channel
  blockers, e.g. verapamil or beta blockers e.g. propranolol)
- Some antipsychotic medications (e.g. clozapine) o Calcium or iron supplements o
  Diuretic medications (e.g. furosemide) o Some antacids o Medications for
  diarrhoea (e.g. loperamide)
- Some medications for seizures (e.g. phenytoin, clonazepam)
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service for specialist input. Referrals for
  bowel problems would typically be to Gastroenterology or Colorectal Surgery.
  Key messages
- Stay hydrated and ensure you eat plenty of fibre.
- Stay active.
- Constipation can affect your Parkinson’s medications. • Get on top of the problem early so it
  doesn’t get worse.

Low Mood
What’s the difference between low mood and depression?
Everyone has times when their mood is low and they feel unhappy about life. This can happen
following a difficult event or experience. It is also possible to feel down without there being a
clear reason. For some people, these periods of low mood are manageable and gradually pass.
For others, low mood may persist for a long time and can affect their day-to-day life. They may
find it more difficult to ‘shake it off’, even for a short time. This may indicate depression. When a
person is depressed it can affect their physical health, their appetite, and their sleep. In the same
way, when a person is physically unwell it can lower their mood.
A general low mood may involve feeling sad, but
it can also involve feeling emotionally ‘flat’ or
‘empty’. When a person has low mood they can
also experience some of the following:

- Lack in self confidence
- Feeling worried or anxious
- Feeling frustrated and irritable
- Feeling tired or lacking energy
  Just because such feelings are common, it does not mean that they have to be accepted as
  inevitable. Making small changes in your life, such as talking about a difficult situation or
  increasing the amount sleep you get, can help to improve your mood. It can also help to keep as
  physically, mentally, and socially active as you can.
  A low mood which persists despite taking positive steps to help manage it can be a sign of
  depression. Depression is more intense and longer lasting than the short periods of low mood
  that anyone can experience from time to time. Depression can have the
  same features as low mood, plus others.
  Symptoms of depression:
- Low, flat or empty mood lasting 2 weeks or more
- No longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to
- Feeling hopeless
- Feeling tired or lacking energy
- Difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)
- Comfort eating or losing your appetite
- Sleeping more than usual or being unable to sleep
  People may feel ‘tired of life’ and that it is not worth living, but not actually want to die.
  Occasionally, people with more severe depression may have thoughts of harming themselves or
  taking their own life.
  What m ight b e c ausing i t?
  Depression does not have a single cause.
  It is a result of a combination of physical
  changes in the brain and the body, a
  person’s past and current life
  experiences, and the ways in which they
  try to cope with them. People with
  Parkinson’s with depression have often
  had periods of depression earlier in their
  life. They may also have family members
  who are prone to depression.
  In Parkinson’s, the chemical changes in the brain can contribute to depression but may not directly
  cause it. While many people with Parkinson’s experience depression at some time, others do not
  despite similar brain changes.
  There is no evidence that drugs to treat Parkinson’s cause depression, but they also do not seem
  to help very much. When someone has their Parkinson’s medication changed they may notice a
  change in their mood, at least at the start. The changing nature of Parkinson’s symptoms
  throughout the day can also mean you experience ups and downs in mood, which aren’t always a
  sign of depression.
  Depression can be difficult to diagnose in someone with Parkinson’s. This is because there
  can be an overlap of symptoms. For example, many people with Parkinson’s experience difficulties
  with sleeping. These difficulties are likely to make you feel tired and lacking in energy. They
  therefore do not necessarily mean you’re depressed. Also, changes in facial movements in
  Parkinson’s can affect facial expression which can be misunderstood. For example someone may
  look sad when they are not.
  Depression is more common in people who have many different long-term health conditions, not
  just Parkinson’s. Depression can also be caused by other common conditions not related to
  Parkinson’s, such as arthritis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This tells us that having any
  long-term health condition may be the most important factor causing depression.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try to help you deal with low mood or depression (see ‘What can
  I try for myself?’). At times, feelings of low mood are completely normal. But, if you have these
  feelings for most of the day, every day for more than 2 weeks, you should make an appointment
  with your GP. Your GP can assess whether your symptoms suggest that you are depressed.
  Depending on the outcome, they may recommend medication or a talking therapy (see ‘Further
  treatments’).
  In some situations, depression can need urgent attention. This may be if you are experiencing any
  of the following:
- Great emotional distress
- Repeated thoughts of death or suicidal ideas
- Thoughts of self-harm or harming others
  If you or a family member feels there is an immediate risk you should go to your nearest Accident
  and Emergency (A&E) department. There will be a trained mental health care professional
  available that you can see. If you cannot get to A&E yourself, you or someone else can call 999
  and ask for an ambulance.
  If you need immediate help but don’t want to go to A&E, you could:
- Call Samaritans on Freephone 116 123 – they're open 24 hours a day and are there to listen
- Contact your GP and ask for an emergency appointment
- Contact NHS 111 (England) or NHS Direct 0845 46 47 (Wales)
- Contact your local crisis team (CRHT), if you’re under their care.
  For more details, the charity Mind has information about how to seek urgent mental health
  support.
  What can I try for myself?
  There are many things you can do that may help to improve your mood. Not
  all of them help everyone, but they are all worth trying. In most cases, they are important for our
  health and well- being, not just as a way to manage low mood or depression.
  Activity
  Exercising regularly can help boost your mood as well as help you sleep. You may choose to do
  this by taking regular walks, going to the gym,
  joining a sports team, going to classes for dance,
  yoga or tai chi. They can also be a source of
  relaxation and a chance to see other people. But
  achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as
  making small changes to your everyday routines.
  For example:
- Tidy up a bit faster when doing the housework
- Use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator
- Leave the car at home for short journeys
- Get off the bus a stop earlier and walk the rest of the journey See Keeping Active pages for
  more guidance.
  If you have any concerns about safe and suitable exercise routines, discuss with your GP or a
  physiotherapist who will be able to recommend exercise that is right for you.
  D
  iet
  Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone. The food you eat can affect the
  way you feel, both physically and mentally, and how you feel can affect the food you eat. So,
  healthy eating habits can improve your mood and general sense of wellbeing.
  For example, people who are depressed can often crave ‘junk food’ that is high in sugar and salt.
  These foods can briefly lift our mood but can lead to highs and lows in our blood glucose. We
  might also feel guilty for over-eating this type of food. This can cause our mood to fluctuate and
  leave us feeling irritable and tired. On the other hand, some people who are depressed may not
  feel like eating and are at risk of becoming underweight.
  It can be beneficial to limit your alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol frequently can lead to depression
  as it lowers your mood (it has a depressant effect on mood). Alcohol also affects sleep. While
  alcohol can initially make you feel more sleepy, it affects your sleep quality. If you drink alcohol
  before going to bed you are less likely to have a refreshing night’s sleep.
  See the Eating Well page for more guidance.
  Keep socially active and combat loneliness
  When a person is depressed they often cut themselves off from other people. Even when not depressed,
  many people can feel isolated and lonely. This can make depression more likely.
  Socialising can improve your mood. Staying in contact with
  friends and family means you have someone to talk to when
  you feel low. Talking to others with Parkinson’s can also help by
  sharing your experiences and learning about different coping
  mechanisms or solutions to similar problems.
  Look out for new opportunities from activities offered through
  local colleges, places of worship (e.g. churches, mosques, temples), community centres, leisure
  facilities, charities and societies (e.g. your local U3A group). Your local library can be a good source
  of information about what is available in your area. We have listed some other possible sources
  on our Practical Advice page. If you need support with travelling to events, see our Travel page
  for advice.
  Visit our Social & Spiritual Life page for more information on how you can keep socially active.
  Sleep
  Depression and anxiety can both affect the quality of our sleep. Similarly, when our sleep is
  disturbed by other things it can negatively affect our mood. Improving your sleep is one of the
  best ways to manage low mood and depression. There are a few things you can try to help
  improve the amount and quality of your sleep:
- Have a strict bed time routine, going to bed at the same time each night
- Leave yourself time to wind down before bed (e.g. avoid using electronic devices for at least
  an hour before you go to bed as these may have a negative effect on sleep)
- Try to relax before going to bed (e.g. reading, a warm bath, gentle music, relaxation or
  stretching exercises)
- Write a “to do” list for the next day before bed can help to clear your mind of any distractions
- Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable.
- Try to avoid caffeine (e.g. tea and coffee) after 2pm.
  See our Sleep Disturbance page for more tips on how to improve the amount and quality of your
  sleep.
  Relaxation and breathing exercises
  It’s important to try and make time to relax. Try doing things you find restful, such as listening to
  music, reading a book, going for a walk, or getting creative by painting or colouring. See the Mind
  charity website, linked in our More Information section, for more tips on how to incorporate
  relaxation into your daily life.
  It can also help to practise calming breathing techniques. This can reduce any stress
  and boost your emotional well-being. See our Dealing with Stress & Challenges page for a simple
  breathing exercise you can try.
  Mindfulness
  Mindfulness encourages you to pay closer attention to the present moment, focusing on your
  thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and your environment. Doing this regularly can help to
  improve your general emotional wellbeing.
  Mindfulness is often included as part of psychological treatment. It is recommended by the
  National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to help prevent the recurrence of depression
  in people that have had several episodes over their lifetime. Mindfulness groups and courses are
  available in some areas. The MIND website gives more information on these and other ways to
  learn Mindfulness. Visit the NHS Mental Health & Wellbeing pages for more information on how
  mindfulness can help mental wellbeing. It also gives guidance on how we can incorporate
  mindfulness into our day-to-day lives. You can find links in our More Information section below.
  Keep a gratitude diary
  Keeping a diary of the things you’re grateful for may lift your mood have a positive effect on your
  mental wellbeing. Try to describe one thing you’re grateful for and do this twice a week. You can
  write about anything that comes to mind, as long as it makes you feel grateful. For example, it
  could be something very little that has happened or a person that you’re grateful for.
  Tips for keeping a gratitude diary…
- Take time to think about something that you’re truly grateful for.
- Writing about people you’re grateful for tends to have more of a positive effect than writing about
  things or events.
- Try to include as much detail as possible about why you’re grateful.
- Plan a time when you will write in your diary. Consider setting an alarm on your phone if you find
  that you are forgetting to write your diary entries.
  Complementary therapies
  Complementary therapies include massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. These
  therapies have not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with
  Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them. These therapies
  may not directly treat the depression but can be helpful for relaxation
  and general wellbeing.
  Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if you wish to
  take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a
  complementary therapy.
  See our Complementary Therapy page for more information.
  Resources for wellbeing and mental health
  There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with
  anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. Most of
  them have not been tested. If you want to try one, look at the mental health apps and tools in the
  NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.
  There are also many books that might be helpful. The Reading Well Books on Prescription website
  has some ideas. Many of these books will be available through your local library. You can find the
  link in our More Information section below.
  Self-help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all
  influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of depression (see ‘Further
  Treatments’ for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by
  the
  NHS for people with depression. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books
  on
  Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit the
  Reading Well Books on Prescription website.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“Sometimes I do have a good old moan and I do have a bit of a cry, because I feel so
frustrated when I can’t do what I want to do. But then I just have to pick myself up and get
going again.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
“I can have a bad day, I can have days when my mood swings are not
very happy because I don’t feel very well. When I’m not well, I’m obviously not happy. That’s
why watching a film sometimes helps because you’re into the film. And you can ignore the
fact of how you’re probably feeling. I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up
and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around
the block.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Further assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more
  questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your “My
  Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about things they
  might ask about with regard to mood.
- How often you are affected by low mood and how long does it last?
- How is low mood affecting your life?
- Are you no longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to?
- Are you feeling hopeless?
- Are you feeling tired or lacking energy?
- Are you having difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)?
- Are you comfort eating or losing your appetite?
- Are you sleeping more than usual or unable to sleep?
- Are you having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm?
- Do you sometimes see or hear things that are not really there? Do you have any other
  unusual experiences?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- If your mood fluctuates during the day, track it over 2-3 days to see when it bothers you most. You
  could also record your sleep patterns if these vary. You could note any factors that you think may
  be related (i.e. things that seem to make your mood worse and things that seem to help). Also
  record when you take your medication as there may be a relationship.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, your healthcare professional may wish to examine you and carry
  out blood or urine tests. Such tests are used to look for other causes of depression, such as thyroid
  conditions or imbalances in the blood (e.g. high calcium levels).
  Further treatments
  Your healthcare professional may be able to give you more specific advice about things you could
  try yourself. They might also refer you on to another service or discuss the option of medication.
  Referral
- Referral would typically be for talking therapies or to mental health teams. Your GP can refer you,
  and it may also be available through your specialist team. In England you can also self-refer for
  talking therapies without going through your GP through [https://www.nh](https://www.nh)s.uk/service-
  search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/. There can be a long wait to start therapy on the
  NHS.
- Talking therapies offer a safe, confidential place to talk to a trained professional about any
  difficulties you are having. o Therapy sessions can be one-to-one with the therapist or in small
  groups.
- There is lots of different types of talking therapies, but they all have the same aim of
  improving your wellbeing. See extra information below about talking therapies.
  o
  Counselling: Counselling can help you cope with mild versions of common mental health
  problems, including depression. It might also help you to talk about a specific event or
  cause for your low mood, such as relationship difficulties or a bereavement. Counselling
  may be available on the NHS. It can also be available for free through your employer. Some
  charities offer cheap or free talking therapies or group support. This includes Cruse for
  bereavement care, Relate for relationship counselling and Mind. Some private counsellors
  also offer discounted rates for those on low incomes. See our More information section
  for details on how to find a trained and accredited therapist.
  o
  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT aims to help you understand how your feelings,
  thoughts, and behaviour influence each other. Your therapist will aim to teach you skills in
  identifying and overcoming ‘unhelpful’ or negative thoughts to help you cope better and
  reduce symptoms of depression. CBT typically involves a course of weekly sessions and may
  be delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or specially trained nurse. For people
  with milder depression, treatment can be done via computer from your own home with
  support from a mental health care professional. CBT for depression will include looking to
  help associated problems such as sleep, lack of physical activity, and social isolation. CBT is
  available on the NHS by self-referral or through your GP.
  o
  Other therapies: While CBT is the most commonly offered therapy, other therapies might
  also be available and recommended. A wide range of other therapies exist. The British
  Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) has an A-Z of therapies, which explains
  what they are. You can talk to your GP or NHS psychological therapy service about other types
  of therapy available in your area.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may
  change your medication.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare
  professional.
- See extra information below about medication used for low mood.
- Antidepressants: For moderate to severe depression, antidepressant medication may be
  prescribed alone or recommended in combination with talking therapy. ‘Combination
  Therapy’ of antidepressant medication with talking therapy can result in better outcomes than
  just receiving one of these treatments. Research has not yet identified a specific type of anti-
  depressant to recommend specifically for people with Parkinson’s. There is some evidence for
  tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline. There is limited evidence for Selective
  Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram or sertraline in Parkinson’s
  specifically. There is good evidence however that they can work for moderate or severe
  depression in the general population. While some antidepressants work very well for some
  people they have no effect for others. Usually, a person is tried on one medicine at increasing
  doses for several weeks to see if it helps. If it does not, then the drug should be slowly
  withdrawn and a different drug tried. Anti-depressants are not addictive but they should not
  be stopped suddenly. If none of the main drugs seem to help, your GP may refer you to a
  specialist for further advice. You can read more about different anti-depressant drugs and
  potential side effects here.
  o
  Parkinson’s medicines: There is some research evidence for the dopamine agonist
  pramipexole, but the effects are modest. Other Parkinson’s drugs have no obvious
  antidepressant effect.
  o
  St John’s wort. St John’s wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for mild-moderate
  depression. It is not recommended by doctors and should never be combined with prescribed
  antidepressants. In particular, it should not be taken by people with Parkinson’s as it can
  interact with a lot of medication, including Parkinson’s medication. It is important you let your
  healthcare professionals know if you are taking this.
- Some medication can make your mood worse. See extra information below about some of these
  medicines. If you are depressed and taking any of these you should not stop them without
  speaking with your GP for advice.
- Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam o Pain killers: opiates o Steroid medication, e.g.
  prednisolone o Beta blockers, e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol o Hormonal medicine, e.g.
  some Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) used for menopausal symptoms or
  hormonal contraceptive medicines.
  Key messages
- Low mood is common and there are many things that you can do to prevent or help it.
- Depression is more intense and longer lasting than the short periods of low
  mood that anyone can have from time to time.
- Things you can do to improve your mood, even if you are not depressed: keep physically and
  socially active; maintain a healthy diet; improve sleep; and make time to relax.
- There is a wide range of possible treatments for depression. Those offered by healthcare
  professionals include talking therapies and medication.

  Anxiety
  Anxiety is the feeling of worry or fear, including a general sense of unease. This feeling can range
  in intensity from mild to severe.
  Everyone can experience feelings of anxiety at some time in their life.
  Anxiety is a natural response to situations that we find stressful or
  threatening. For example, this might be about your health,
  moving house or work-related problems. It may subside once the
  situation changes or the person becomes used to the situation.
  But sometimes feelings of anxiety can last for long periods of time
  and without a clear cause. This can be troubling for the person
  and can affect their day-to- day life.
  Common symptoms of anxiety
  There are a range of symptoms experienced with anxiety which varies from person to person.
  Listed below are some of the more common features:
  Body Sensations Thoughts & Feelings Changes in Behaviour

* Muscle pain or tension • A sense of dread • Repeated checking or
* Heart beating fast, or • Constant worry seeking reassurance
  palpitations • Difficulty • Avoiding situations or
* Dizziness concentrating places that are associated
* Feeling sick • Feeling detached from with stress or anxiety
* Dry mouth your environment • Restlessness
* Tingling sensations • Feeling on edge and
  (particularly in the hands alert to things around
  and feet) you
* Difficulty breathing or • Feeling agitated or
  feeling breathless irritable
* Sweating
* Trembling
  The body sensations are the physical response to stress and threat. However, the same sensations
  can be caused by a number of acute and long-term physical health conditions including
  Parkinson’s.
  They can also be a side effect of some medications. If someone is experiencing the body sensations
  without the thoughts and feelings or changes in behaviour, they are unlikely to be anxious.
  Worry is one of the most common features of anxiety in people with Parkinson’s. Some worry is
  normal. Indeed, a bit of worry can be useful as it forces us to think ahead and plan for stressful
  events. But worry can become excessive, taking up much of our time as well as our emotional
  energy. Such worry is often unproductive – it does not lead to solutions to problems. Instead, it
  traps us in a cycle of ‘what-ifs’ and expecting the worse. While we can sometimes distract
  ourselves from such worry, it tends to come back – often when we are trying to sleep.
  Anxiety also changes our behaviour; we look for ways to reduce unpleasant body sensations and
  distressing thoughts and feelings. For example, we might be repeatedly check we have done
  something or ask for reassurance from others. These behaviours can give short-term relief, but
  they do not break the cycle. The most common behaviour change in anxiety is avoidance. Once
  we work out what we are afraid of, it makes sense to avoid it. This is OK sometimes. However, it
  becomes a problem if it leads to us avoiding going out of the house, using public transport or
  socialising. Although avoidance can lead to a short-term reduction in anxiety, it makes whatever
  we are avoiding even more frightening.
  What sorts of things are people with Parkinson’s anxious about?
  Uncertainty about the future can be difficult and can cause anxiety and worry. This might be
  particularly the case with health conditions that have an unpredictable course, such as Parkinson’s.
  Some people are generally anxious about any stressful and potentially threatening situation. For
  others, it is more specific. For example, they may feel very anxious in social situations or in
  crowded places with lots of strangers around. People will often feel anxious before and during
  such situations. In a few people, the anxiety may increase very suddenly – a so-called ‘panic
  attack’. These can be very distressing. A person will often avoid situations where they have had a
  panic attack in the past.
  What might be causing it?
  Anxiety can be caused by a combination of factors. Such factors include imbalances in brain
  chemicals, genetics, and stressful life events. People who have been anxious throughout their life
  may find that their anxiety has got worse since their Parkinson’s started. This may be due to the
  brain changes, or because Parkinson’s increases the number of ‘threats’ faced day-to-day. In other
  words, they may have more to be anxious about.
  Some symptoms of Parkinson’s can cause anxiety or make it worse. For example, after a fall or
  loss of balance, you may develop a fear of falling. See the Balance and Falls page for guidance on
  this.
  Some people experience anxiety when their medication is wearing off. This improves once they
  take their next dose of medication. You can also feel anxious if your medication is wearing off and
  you experience difficulties moving. You may find that when your movement symptoms are better
  controlled by medication, your levels of anxiety reduce.
  Alcohol, caffeine, and some illicit drugs can make anxiety worse. Withdrawing from a substance
  or medication can also increase anxiety levels. Hormonal imbalances, such as high thyroid
  hormone levels, are another possible cause of anxiety.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try to help you deal with anxiety (see ‘What can I try for myself?’).
  If anxiety is having a big impact on your life, you should speak to a healthcare professional. In
  some cases, anxiety has a negative impact on other symptoms of Parkinson’s. For example, stress
  and anxiety can make tremor worse, interfere with walking, and increase the risk of falls. Seeking
  support early can give you more control and help you manage feelings of anxiety.
  Anxiety and depression often occur at the same time, and anxiety can make depression even more
  difficult to live with. You should seek urgent professional help if you are feeling great emotional
  distress or are experiencing feelings that are difficult to manage. These can include thoughts of
  death, suicidal ideas, thoughts of self-harm, panic attacks, flashbacks, and paranoia or hearing
  voices. You should speak to your GP in the first instance or go to A&E if not available and you are
  experiencing these. You can normally get an emergency appointment through your GP practice
  for urgent mental health concerns.
  If you need immediate help but don’t want to see your GP or go to A&E, you could:

  support.
  What can I try for myself?
  There are many things you can try to help manage and reduce anxiety. These include:
  Activity
  Being more active can help to combat stress and reduce anxiety. You
  may choose to do this by going to the gym or going to classes e.g.
  dance, yoga, or tai chi. But achieving a more active lifestyle can be as
  simple as making small changes to your everyday routines. For
  example:
* Tidy up a bit faster when doing the housework
* Extending walks to the shops/other errands a bit further, or going
  more often
* Use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator
* Leave the car at home for short journeys
* Get off the bus a stop earlier and walking the rest of the journey See Keeping Active pages for
  more guidance.
  If you have any concerns about safe and suitable exercise routines, discuss with your GP
  or a physiotherapist who will be able to recommend exercise that is right for you.
  Diet
  Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone. The food we eat can affect the
  way we feel, both physically and mentally, and how we feel can affect the food we eat. Anxiety
  can make you feel nauseous, or reduce your appetite, and it is important to still eat healthily if it
  is affecting you in this way. Some people ‘comfort eat’ when they feel anxious, for example extra
  sugary foods, which might lead to feeling guilty and increasing anxiety further.
  It can help to cut down on the amount of caffeine (found in tea, coffee, and some fizzy drinks) and
  alcohol you drink. This is because these can make some symptoms of anxiety (e.g. heart racing)
  worse.
  Healthy eating habits can play an important role in improving our mood and general sense of well- being.
  See Eating Well for more guidance.
  Keep socially active
  Sharing any worries or fears you may have with a friend or family member may help to reduce
  anxiety levels. Talking to others with Parkinson’s can also help by sharing your experiences and
  learning about different coping mechanisms or solutions to similar problems.
  You can look out for new opportunities from activities offered through local colleges, churches, leisure
  facilities, charities, and societies. You can search for activities and groups in your area on the government
  website gov.uk . Your local library can also be a good source of information about what is available in your
  area. If you need support with travelling to events, see our Travel page for advice.
  Visit our Social & Spiritual Life & Spiritual page for more information on how you can keep socially
  active.
  Sleep
  Many people with anxiety or worry may find it difficult getting to sleep. Our sleep page has some
  information on this and what you can try to help.
  Relaxation
  It’s important to try and make time to relax. Try
  doing things you find restful. This might be
  listening to music, reading a book, going for a
  walk, or getting creative by painting or
  colouring.
  See the Mind charity website for more tips on how
  to incorporate relaxation into your daily life.
  They also have example relaxation exercises you can try.
  Breathing strategies
  Calming breathing exercises can help to reduce anxiety. When you feel anxious, you are more
  likely to take rapid, shallow breaths. This can cause sensations such as increased heart rate,
  dizziness, and muscle tension. In turn, this can increase feelings of anxiety. So, doing simple
  breathing exercises can help you to relax and reduce anxiety levels. These exercises work best
  when they’re practised regularly. You can even make them part of your daily routine (e.g. doing
  some deep breathing while waiting for the kettle to boil).
  Here’s an example of a simple breathing exercise you can try:
* Get into a position that you find comfortable (this can be standing, sitting, lying, etc.).
* Try to keep your shoulders down and relaxed and place your hand on your stomach.
* Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach rise as you
  breathe in and fall as you breathe out.
* You may find it helpful to count steadily as you breathe: ‘one, two, three, four, five’ as you
  breathe in and ‘one, two, three, four, five’ as you breathe out. Try to work out what feels
  comfortable for you.
* Repeat for 3-5 minutes.
  Mindfulness
  Mindfulness encourages you to pay closer attention to the present moment, focusing on your
  thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and your environment. By doing this regularly it can help to
  improve your general emotional well-being.
  Mindfulness is often included as part of psychological treatment. It encourages you to notice any
  stress or anxiety you might be feeling and can help you to deal with this better. Visit the NHS
  Mental Health & Wellbeing pages for more information on how mindfulness can help our mental
  well-being. You can find the link in our More Information section below. It also gives guidance on
  how we can incorporate mindfulness into our day-to-day lives.
  Complementary t herapies
  Complementary therapies include massage,
  acupuncture and aromatherapy. These therapies have
  not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with
  Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them.
  These therapies may not directly treat the anxiety but
  can be helpful for relaxation and general well-being.
  Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if
  you
  wish to take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a complementary therapy.
  See our Complementary Therapy page for more information.
  Resources for wellbeing and mental health
  There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with
  anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. If you want
  to try one, look at the mental health apps and tools in the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.
  Here is a selection of self-help leaflets available online that might be helpful. You can find these in
  our More Information section. Alternatively, there are some books (e.g., ‘The worry cure’ By
  Robert Leahy). The Reading Well Books on Prescription web page has some other suggestions.
  Many of these books will be available through your local library or available to buy from local
  bookstores or online.
  Some books are available in audiobook format, if preferred.
  There are also some websites that have a wide range of advice and resources groups. You can pay
  to become a member of these groups, if you wish. See the More Information section.
  Self-help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy
  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all
  influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of anxiety (see ‘Further
  Treatments’ for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by
  the NHS for people with anxiety. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books
  on Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit
  the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.
  Worry management
  There are some simple tricks that we can use to take back control of our repetitive unproductive
  worry.
* ‘Worry time’: worry thoughts can happen at any time. The thing we are
  worrying about may be important so we feel that deserves our attention. However, it can get
  in the way of other things. One simple trick is to plan one or two short periods of ‘worry time’
  during the day. These are the times that you allow yourself to worry. Because you know that
  you can come back to the worry later, it is easier to switch it off at the time it pops into your
  head. Interestingly, when your scheduled worry time comes along, the worry often does not
  seem so worrying.
* Make a note of your worry and come back to it later: Worries often run through our minds
  when we have no distractions. Unfortunately, this is often when we are trying to relax or sleep.
  Keep a notebook beside your bed or arm-chair and jot down a quick note about the worry.
  Then come back to it later – either during your worry time or in the morning. Again, the worry
  often seems less powerful.
  A small study of self-help, using these and other simple techniques, showed that they can
  significantly reduce the amount of time that people spend worrying. The study used an short
  guide published on- line in Australia called ‘What? Me Worry?’ available in our More Information
  section.
  Avoid avoidance
  Avoidance is a central feature of anxiety. It helps in the short-term but makes things worse overall.
  It can also restrict important aspects of day-to-day living.
  Avoidance tends to build up gradually and is something that we learn to do – without intending
  it.
  We unlearn avoidance if we realise that we can cope with the stressful situation, even if it is
  difficult.
  Often avoidance is an all-or-none response. For example, if shopping is difficult because of crowds,
  it is better to change the time or the place to one that is less crowded, rather than avoiding shops
  completely. This is adapting to the situation rather than avoiding it.
  Practical planning and problem-solving can remove some stress and make avoidance less likely.
  This advanced thinking is much more productive than worry. Friends and family can often help
  find solutions to help you do the things that you are tending to avoid. But, it is important that they
  don’t encourage avoidance thinking that this will help you feel less anxious.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“In a sense, this is a similar process to a bereavement and you need time to adjust before
getting back on an even keel. I worried that the level of anxiety I felt in the weeks after
diagnosis were a symptom of Parkinson's and would be with me for life. When a distant
friend told me that life would be good again, I remember being really surprised but
also encouraged.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
“It’s weird. There's no reason, absolutely no reason why I should be [anxious]. It just seems
to build up and get worse. No, I can't put it down to anything. There's nothing in particular
that I can think of that makes it start. It just comes over you. ….I think if I just breathe.
What I usually do is I’ll sit back and I’ll sort of take deep breaths and then I just sort of think,
‘calm down, just calm down’, you know, and sort of bring myself back again. So, that’s the
only way I can get out of it, really. Or go and sit and do some drawing or go sit and put the
television on and takes my mind off it” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Further Assessment
At times, feelings of anxiety are completely normal. But, anxiety can begin to disrupt your day-to-day
life or cause you distress. If this is the case, it is important to seek help from healthcare professionals.
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance.
  You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below to see things they might ask about with regard to anxiety.
- Are you experiencing any physical symptoms? If so, what are these?
- What life events or stressors are happening?
- Are there any triggers for your anxiety?
- Thoughts or actions related to mood, such as thinking about self-harm or suicide
- How anxiety is impacting your life, for example your sleep
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- Monitor when you’re anxious and what’s happening for you at that time. Write down anything
  that may be related to the anxiety (i.e. things that seem to make your anxiety worse and things
  that appear to make it better). Make a note of any physical symptoms and when you take your
  medication. Try to do this for three days – this should be enough to be able to look for a
  pattern.
  It is best not to get too caught up in monitoring your symptoms as this can make anxiety worse.
  Tests
  Tests are not usually needed when assessing for anxiety. But your
  healthcare professional may wish to examine you or carry out tests, such as blood tests. This
  would help to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms.
  Further Treatments
  Your healthcare professional may be able to give you more specific advice about things you could
  try yourself. They might also refer you on to another service or discuss the option of medication.
  Referral
- There is often a waiting time before that next service will see you. Referral would typically be
  for talking therapies or to mental health teams.
- Talking therapies are often first choice for anxiety.
- They offer a safe, confidential place to talk to a trained professional about any difficulties
  you are having.
- Therapy sessions can be one-to-one with the therapist or in small groups.
- There are various types of talking therapies, but they all aim to improve your well-being.
  See extra information below about talking therapies.
- Counselling: Counselling can help you cope with mild versions of common mental health
  problems, including anxiety.
- Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT): CBT focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and
  behaviour influence each other and can lead to, or worsen, feelings of anxiety. It works
  by encouraging you to change these patterns by challenging ‘unhelpful’ thoughts and
  behaviour. There is evidence that CBT is particularly effective in treating anxiety, but it
  can also help you cope with chronic health problems. CBT typically involves a course of
  weekly sessions. It can be delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or specially
  trained nurse. Treatment for mild anxiety can be done via computer from your own home
  with support from a mental health care professional.
- Link worker service: Most areas in England now offer a link worker service. You can ask
  about this at your GP practice. This is someone who can help link you up to local support
  available in your area. This might include activities and groups related to your interests,
  or local low cost counselling or other support options.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g.
  Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without
  speaking with a healthcare professional.
- If severe anxiety is affecting your quality of life, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team
  may discuss the option of medication. There are different types of medication available for
  anxiety and the choice is personal to you. But, there are none specifically recommended for
  Parkinson’s’ and there have been no clinical trials looking into this.
  See extra information below about medication used for anxiety.
- Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g. sertraline and citalopram
- Other medications also used for depression, e.g. mirtazapine or Serotonin and
  norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine
- Some drugs also used to for pain e.g. gabapentin or pregabalin
- Very occasionally, short term use of benzodiazepines
- Sometimes beta blockers are used for symptoms of panic. It should be used with caution as
  it can lower blood pressure.
  See extra information below about some medications that may worsen anxiety.
- Caffeine - this is present in some over-the-counter pain killers and flu remedies
- Some decongestants
- Steroid medication
- Medication used for asthma (e.g. salbutamol)
- Levothyroxine
  Key Messages
- Anxiety is the feeling of worry or fear, including a general sense of unease. It can range in
  intensity from mild to severe.
- There are many things you can do to help improve your mood, even if you don’t have anxiety.
  These include exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, improving sleep, and making time to relax.
  You can also tackle worry and avoidance.
- Treatments for anxiety offered by healthcare professionals include talking therapies and
  medication.

  Loss of Interest or Drive
  Loss of interest or drive is sometimes called apathy. It
  is not the same as feeling low or depressed, although
  loss of interest can also be part of depression.
  Sometimes to an outsider, apathy can even be
  confused with laziness, but it can in fact be a
  symptom of Parkinson’s. For some people apathy
  mainly affects their engagement with activities such
  as hobbies or pastimes. For others it can affect more
  routine day-to-day activities such as taking care of
  themselves.
  There are times when we all avoid doing things because they are too difficult. However, this is not
  the same as apathy. Apathy is when a person can do something, especially when encouraged by
  others, but does not do so if left to themselves. They are not avoiding it – simply they have no
  wish to do it or cannot make a start. If you feel like you have lost your spark, or can’t be bothered
  to do anything:
  that might be apathy.
  What might be causing it?
  Apathy is a symptom of Parkinson’s as well as other neurological conditions. There is evidence
  that it is linked to the levels of dopamine in the brain. This link is different from how we know
  dopamine affects movement. Apathy in Parkinson’s can be present by itself. It can also be linked
  to low mood, memory and thinking problems.
  What should I do about it?
  The feeling of apathy can be hard to change. There is no quick fix, but you should routinely talk to
  your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team about it so they can assess for a cause and potentially treat
  related symptoms.
  Even if your interest and drive is low, it is important to remain active. Managing apathy as well as
  you can is good for your mental and physical health, and can help the people that you live with.
  There are some changes you can make that can help you deal with apathy (see section ‘What can
  I try for myself?’).
  What can I try for myself?
  There are three main ways to tackle apathy. First, by establishing a routine so that the activity
  becomes more of a ‘habit’. Second, by building a menu of things that you can select from to do.
  Third, by agreeing with other people that they are allowed to remind or prompt you when you
  are not being active.
  Establishing a routine
  Apathy tends to affect activities that we do less often, especially where we can choose to do them
  or not. Regular activities and habits tend to be less affected. Building a regular routine within the
  day or across the week is a good way to tackle apathy. This can also improve your mood. Your
  routine can include anything that you want, but the best routines have some variety. It is useful
  to think of a number of activities that you can do from different categories.
  Chores
  There are always things that need doing
  about the house, in the garden or wherever. These
  may be things that you have done in the past but
  have stopped doing. There may be other chores
  that a family member does that you could take
  over or help with. These may not be fun but they
  are useful and often provide an opportunity for
  some physical activity. You may want to sit down
  with people in your family to work out what chores
  do a nd a gree a ti me w hen t hey w ill b e done. you can
  Hobbies and pastimes
  When a person has apathy, hobbies and pastimes are often one of
  the first things to be affected. Sometimes these have become
  difficult because of Parkinson’s. Even if you cannot do all the
  things you used to enjoy, find a few that you can still do and build
  one or two of these into your routine.
  For more advice, see our Hobbies & Pets page.
  Physical activity
  Apathy tends to lead to physical inactivity and that has consequences. While it is important for
  everyone to keep active, it is especially important when a person is apathetic. Even if they are able
  to get up and move around, they may spend much of their time sitting. Chores, hobbies and
  pastimes can offer chances to be more active. You can also build in a small amount of exercise into
  your routine.
  For more advice, see our Keeping Active page.
  Social activity
  Think about what chances you have to be around others –family, friends or members of
  organisations and groups that you belong to. Apart from unscheduled social activity such as
  phone calls, try to plan at least 2 or 3 activities each week. These could include going to an
  organised external activity, calling a friend or having tea with a neighbour. If you do these things
  at roughly the same day and time each week it will make them easier to do. It may be possible to
  combine social activity with hobbies, pastimes and exercise.
  For more advice, see our Social & Spiritual Life page.
  Make a ‘menu’
  There will be times when it feels like you have nothing to do, or do not want to do things that
  need doing. For someone with apathy it can be hard to think of options. It is often useful to make
  a menu of things to do. Making a choice from alternatives is easier than deciding from scratch.
  Don’t have too many things on the menu but try to have some variety, with options from the
  range of activities described above. Avoid activities that take too long, are complex or involve too
  much planning.
  Someone with apathy may either not start or be unable to finish them.
  The importance of prompts and reminders
  One of the key features of apathy is that a person tends
  not to do things if left to their own devices. Routines
  and menus can help, but usually there is a need for
  prompts and reminders. Family members can
  sometimes be reluctant to do this, perhaps because
  they don’t want to ‘nag’. However, this is important in
  apathy. Prompts and reminders may involve talking
  through the planned routine
  activity seems to have stopped.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house.
Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.” Person with Parkinson’s.
Further assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so think about these in advance. You can
  record them in the My Health section in your manual to bring to the appointment.
  See extra information below about what they might ask about with regard to apathy.
- How is your mood?
- Have you noticed any changes in your memory or thinking?
- Are there times when you feel like yourself and engaged, and other times when you feel
  disinterested and can’t be bothered? Or is it continuous?
- Have you noticed any relationship with your medication?
  Track your symptoms in your tracker (in your manual)
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional look for patterns.
- It can be that you have difficulty remembering when it is a problem. If so, you could make a note of it
  in the diary in the days or week before your appointment.
- However it is not likely to be helpful to closely track over a prolonged period (e.g. more than
  a week)
  Tests
  It is usually not needed to take tests to assess apathy.
  Further treatments
- At this time there are not a lot of treatments, such as medication or special therapy, for apathy
  itself.
- It can be that apathy is related to depression. This means treatment of depression (e.g. therapy
  or antidepressant medication) may help.
- It can be that the apathy is related to memory or thinking problems. This has been shown to
  improve with the medication used for these problems (cholinesterase inhibitors such as
  rivastigmine).
- Your healthcare team may be able to advise where to find groups that offer support.
- It can be that apathy is impacting your daily living and so you need more practical support. Your
  GP may then refer you to the community occupational therapy team. You can also contact your
  local social services for a Needs Assessment.
  Key messages
- Apathy can be a symptom of Parkinson’s, linked to mood or thinking problems. It can also
  happen on its own.
- You can have a structured routine, make choices easier, and provide prompts and reminders.
  These are important to manage apathy.

  Stiffness, Slowness & Small Movements
  Stiffness or rigidity is generally felt in the muscles of the
  body. Muscles don’t stretch or relax as they usually do.
  This can cause feelings of pain or tightness in people’s
  muscles. People with Parkinson’s may notice they have
  difficulty with small movements of their hands. This may
  be when buttoning buttons, shaving their face or writing
  with a pen. They may also have trouble rolling over in bed
  or getting out of a chair. Facial muscles may also be stiff,
  and a person with Parkinson’s may have less facial
  expression than they used to.
  Slowness of movement also happens in Parkinson’s. This can be seen in someone’s overall
  movements being slower, for example, their walking or gestures. Repeated movements can also
  become smaller or slower the more the actions are repeated. This can happen when doing a lot
  of writing by hand, for example. People with Parkinson’s can also have slower reaction times or
  take smaller and more shuffling steps. Stiffness, slowness and difficulty with small movements
  may also contribute to falls and pain.
  What might be causing it?
  In Parkinson’s, the movement symptoms of the condition are caused mainly by having reduced
  levels of dopamine in the brain. Movement symptoms are otherwise known as motor symptoms
  and include stiffness, slowness, and tremor. Although Parkinson’s medications do not slow down
  the progression of the condition, in many cases they can help reduce the frequency and severity
  of these symptoms.
  Some people with Parkinson’s develop a frozen shoulder, often before they have been diagnosed
  with Parkinson’s. This is stiffness, pain and a reduced range of movement in the shoulder.
  Stiffness can also occur with other medical conditions. The most common non-Parkinson’s cause
  is osteoarthritis. Other problems in the joints, bones or muscles can also cause stiffness. It can
  sometimes be complicated to sort out what stiffness is related to Parkinson’s and what may be
  due to another health issue. If the symptom changes in response to Parkinson’s medication, then
  it is more likely that it is being caused by Parkinson’s.
  Slow movements can be the result of other problems too – for example due to pain, tiredness,
  low mood or slowed thinking. These can be in relation to Parkinson’s or a separate issue.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself as described below. Although there are some
  circumstances where you should seek professional help. If you are having problems turning over
  in bed, getting dressed, or walking, it is time to speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
  Similarly, if stiffness and slowness are bothering you, and you don’t see improvement by one
  month of following the advice below, seek help from your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
  What can I try for myself?
  Activity
  There are 2 aspects to this:

1. Undertaking Activity: This can help lengthen and stretch muscles and reduces the impact of
   movement changes over time. The type of activity depends on your personal circumstances.
   Doing exercise regularly is important for everyone.
2. Reducing periods of sitting: e.g. Walking breaks during the day to break up periods of sitting still.
   See Keeping Active section for more tips about activities. Ideally these are tailored for you by a
   physiotherapist or occupational therapist. Here are a few specific tips for symptoms of stiffness,
   slowness and smaller movements. None of these should be painful. If you experience pain, talk
   to your physiotherapist, GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
   Big Movements

- Movements may get smaller with Parkinson’s.
- Giving attention to this can overcome it.
- Think about the size of movements as you do them, e.g. think about big steps.
- Practice tasks, focusing on the size of the movements.
  Stretches
- Stretching should feel like a gentle pull on the muscle, not be
  painful.
- Hold each stretch for 10-30 seconds, keeping it still and steady.
- Breathe slowly in and out during the stretch. Don’t hold your
  breath.
- Repeat each stretch 3-4 times, with a brief break between.
- Work through the different parts of the body.
- Try to make this a routine part of your life, several times per week.
  Shoulder movements
- To help keep the shoulders moving well, give them specific attention
- During your time stretching, include some shoulder movements:
- Shrug your shoulders up toward your ears and back down again o Roll the shoulders
  in circles (forwards and backwards) o Move your shoulders backwards (‘retraction’)
  like you are pulling your shoulder blades together
- Exaggerate the movements, trying to make them as big as possible.
  Hand movements
- Dexterity can be affected by Parkinson’s.
- Exercises ideally include a range of functions: o Practicing control of
  force, i.e. grip of small objects. o Practicing moving the fingers one at
  a time. o Practicing coordinating finger movements, i.e. which
  fingers move together or separately, and the timing of movements.
- There are many different ways of, for example:
- Writing or drawing tasks o Handling small objects, like turning coins, or screwing
  nuts onto bolts.
- Modelling with clay or playdough
  Warm baths
- May help relax stiff muscles.
- Make sure you are well hydrated if you have warm baths.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“If you’ve got, you know, slow hands, shaking, you know, hands, legs, a bike or hand exercises
would be best because that will relieve the tension and the stiffness in your hands. Keep using
them and they will get better.” (Person with Parkinsons)
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance.
  You could record them in My Health section in your manual to bring to the appointment.
  See extra information below about things they might ask about with regard to
  slowness and stiffness.
- When is the stiffness or slowness a problem?
- Which part of the body is affected?
- Do you notice any response to medication?
- How does it impact your daily activities?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in your manual
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- You could record times when movements are most difficult, and when you take your medication
  during the day. 3-5 days of tracking should be enough to see a pattern.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, healthcare professionals may run further tests such as X-rays or
  scans of joints if it is not thought to be related to Parkinson’s.
  Further Treatments
  The main treatments for these symptoms are (physical) therapies and medication.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may
  change your medication if within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare
  professional.
- Parkinson’s medications are used for stiffness, slowness and difficulty with small movements:
  See Medication page for more information.
- See Pain page for how pain might be treated if this is restricting your movements.
  Therapies
- You may be referred on to another service for this.
- Please be aware there is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you. If you wish to be
  referred privately you should tell the professional making the referral.
- Different specialists often work together in a team:
- Physiotherapy tends to focus on movements.
- Occupational therapy tends to focus on tasks, e.g. small hand movements for getting dressed.
  Key Messages
- Stiffness, slowness and difficulty with small movements are some of the main motor
  symptoms of Parkinson’s disease
- Physiotherapy, occupational therapy, regular activity, stretching, and adjustment to
  Parkinson’s medications are the best ways of treating stiffness and slowness

Involuntary Movements (Dyskinesia)
Introduction
‘Dyskinesias’ are typically quick muscle movements that you cannot control. These movements
include wriggling, writhing, twisting, head bobbing, or swaying motions. They can affect one part
of the body (e.g. the trunk), arms or legs, or the whole body.
Some people experience dyskinesia when their medications are at the highest levels in the body.
Others have dyskinesia when their medications are at the lowest levels in the body (i.e. just before
or just after taking medication).
Dyskinesias can range in severity, from some people having it so mildly that they do not notice the
movements to others who have severe dyskinesias. Many people with Parkinson’s say their
dyskinesias do not bother them, and they would prefer to feel more “on” with dyskinesias and be
able to do more, than have fewer dyskinesias but feel more “off” and not be able to do as much.
What might be causing it?
The exact cause of dyskinesia isn’t known. Experts think it's related to the natural progression of
Parkinson’s and the brain becoming more sensitive to dopamine.
It is more common for dyskinesia to develop after a few years of levodopa treatment, but some
develop them earlier and others never develop dyskinesias.
Dyskinesia tends to get worse when stressed or anxious.
What should I do about it?
If dyskinesias aren’t bothering you or impacting on your daily life, then there's nothing you need
to do.
If there are lots of extra movements, this can burn extra calories and cause unintended weight
loss (see weight & appetite loss page).
There are some ideas below for how to manage your dyskinesia. But if they are impacting your
daily life or bothering you, discuss them with your Parkinson’s specialist team.
What can I try for myself?
Managing Stress Like many Parkinson’s symptoms,
dyskinesias are worse when stressed. Finding
ways to stay relaxed can be helpful.

- Massage, tai chi, yoga and deep breathing exercises
  may be helpful tools in managing stress.
  Let your body guide you
  If you notice particular times when your movements
  are good (e.g. feeling “on”) and you don’t have extra movements, make the most of these times to do
  things you enjoy.
  Explain to others
  You can explain to others that the extra movements are part of your Parkinson’s and nothing to be
  concerned about.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“It can be brought on by all sorts of different things and can cause falls and the like. If we
go out, we try and plan it so that we go out at what is likely to be the best window of
opportunity with the medication. If we leave it too long, then [dyskinesia] problems occur.”
Carer of someone with Parkinson’s.
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your My Health section in your manual to bring to the
  appointment.
- Things they might ask about:
- When does the dyskinesia happen?
- Before you take your medication (and how long before)?
- After you take your medication (and how long after you take your medication)?
- Do they happen in between doses of medication (how much time has passed between
  doses?)
- How many hours per day do you think you are having dyskinesias?
- Does it bother you? What is the impact of the dyskinesia?
- Have you noticed weight loss?
- Does dyskinesia cause you balance problems or falls?
- Have you sustained any injuries related to the extra movements?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity
  Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the
  professional identify patterns.
- For 3-5 days you could monitor your dyskinesias and when
  you take your medication. This will help you to notice any
  patterns in your dyskinesias.
  Further Treatments
  A healthcare professional may be able to offer support, advice, or further treatment. They may
  suggest a change in your treatment if the dyskinesias are severe or bothering you.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may
  change your medication if it’s within their expertise.
  Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
- Changes to medication to control dyskinesia would most likely be made by your Parkinson’s specialist
  team.
  See extra information below about the sorts of changes they might recommend.
- They may change the dose of your antiparkinsonian medications, as lowering doses can
  sometime reduce dyskinesias (or occasionally increasing it)
- They may change the timing of your medication:
- Splitting the entire daily dose of levodopa into smaller, more frequent doses may
  be helpful for managing dyskinesia
- They may change which medication you take:
- For example, changing from one antiparkinsonian treatment to another
- stopping or starting a long-acting antiparkinsonian medication o They may add
  medications to your current regimen, for example adding one of the following
  medications:
- Amantadine
- Dopamine agonist (e.g. ropinirole, or rotigotine)
- COMT inhibitor (e.g. entacapone)
- MAO-B inhibitor (e.g. safinamide)
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service. There is usually a waiting time before that next service
  will see you.
- If dyskinesia is impacting on your daily activities, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team may refer you
  to an occupational therapist. An occupational therapist can help assess whether you'd benefit from
  additional equipment or support.
- In severe cases where medication is not helping, more advanced therapies may be considered.
  This often involves a referral to a specialist centre for an assessment. These therapies include:
- Apomorphine – continuous infusion of medication
  under the skin
- Intraduodenal levodopa – continuous infusion of gel
  form levodopa via the intestine
- Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery
  See Medication and Advanced & Surgical Treatments pages for
  more information.
  Key Messages
- Dyskinesias are involuntary muscle movements that include swaying, twisting, bobbing, or swaying
  motions.
- Dyskinesias may happen right before, right after, or between medication doses and the treatment
  differs for each.
- Changes to medication type and schedule are common management strategies for dyskinesia.

  Tremor
  Tremor is an uncontrollable, involuntary movement of a part of the body. Around one in three
  people with Parkinson’s never experience tremor. For others, it may be the most noticeable
  symptom. It may start in one area, like the right hand, and then gradually spread to another area
  on the same side of the body, like the right leg; it can eventually move to the other side of the
  body.
  What might be causing it?
  Parkinson’s ‘motor’ symptoms – tremor, slowness and stiffness - are caused by having reduced
  levels of dopamine in the brain. It can be difficult to discern a Parkinson’s tremor from a non-
  Parkinson’s tremor.
  Parkinson’s tremor is usually seen when the affected body part is at rest. This may be, for example,
  your hand is at rest on your lap or supported in some way and has a tremor. The tremor is
  sometimes called a ‘pill-rolling’ tremor. This
  is because it can look as if someone is trying
  to roll a pill between their thumb and
  forefinger. Besides the hands, a Parkinson’s
  tremor can also impact the arms, feet, legs,
  lips and tongue. It tends to affect one side of
  the body first and then, after several years,
  may spread to the other side of the body.
  People also sometimes report the feeling of
  an ‘internal tremor’ that isn’t visible to
  others; sometimes a visible tremor appears
  later. Sometimes people with Parkinson’s will have a tremor that happens both at rest and also
  while they are doing actions.
  Non-Parkinson’s tremor can be due to multiple factors.

* Physiological tremor is a normal body response to situations that provoke feelings of fear, stress,
  or anxiety.
* Essential tremor is usually seen when body parts are in motion – for example, a tremor that is
  worse with holding a cup and drinking; but can also affect the voice, head, body and legs. It also
  tends to affect both sides of the body from onset. It is a common tremor and it can be difficult to
  differentiate between this and a Parkinson’s tremor.
* Tremors can also be caused by some medications (such as salbutamol inhalers), caffeine, some
  imbalances of blood chemistry (such as high levels of thyroid hormones, or low blood sugar
  levels), and in response to withdrawal of alcohol having become dependent.
  Whatever the cause, most tremors get worse when the individual is anxious or stressed.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself as below. If despite these, the tremor is
  very bothersome, speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team routinely about possible changes to
  your treatment. Unfortunately treatments and strategies do not completely stop the tremor. The
  aim is to minimise the impact on daily life.
  What can I try for myself?
  You may find different things that make the tremor more or less pronounced. Some things that have
  been researched are listed below.
  These may make tremor less pronounced:
* Activities that decrease or manage stress or anxiety: yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, self-
  relaxation techniques
* Some people find that exercise reduces their tremor
* Many people also find it helpful to talk with others with Parkinson’s about their symptoms
  These may make tremor more pronounced:
* Stress or anxiety, or any emotional response
* Caffeine
  Sometimes tremors can make specific tasks more difficult. Extra adaptations, support or equipment
  may be needed for those tasks:
* Eating and drinking – special cutlery or cups may help – see Daily Living page for more ideas.
* Taking medication – pill organisers may be easier to
  handle than the original packets – see Medication
  page for more ideas.
* Technology: some people find touch screen difficult to
  control with a tremor and find using a mouse
  easier; others use voice control. Most smartphones
  allow for voice dictation instead of typing. Similarly
  using a device such as an Alexa can be helpful. See our Reading, Writing & Technology page for
  more ideas.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“For me, my tremor can lead to tension/aching in the whole arm and shoulder. As it is
primarily a resting tremor, I find it helpful to have something like a squeeze ball or fir cone
to hold in the hand. Also, I find that using my hand for, say, knitting releases the tension in
the arm.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
“A couple of things occur to me from my own experience of tremor;
things I didn’t realise when I was first diagnosed. One is that some skills are so engrained
in the motor memory that they seem to bypass tremor. So, for some people, their tremor
disappears when they are driving, riding a bicycle, playing golf or playing an instrument.
So keep practising those scales! It’s a ‘use it or lose it’ thing. Also, being diagnosed with a
tremor doesn’t draw a line under acquiring new skills. I was inspired to start learning the
piano by a woman I met on a Parkinson’s Patients
Committee who had taken up the saxophone. I’m now working on my Grade Three pieces.”
(Person with Parkinson’s)
Further assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section in your manual to bring to the
  appointment.
- Things they might ask about:
- When does the tremor happen? o Do you notice any response
  to medication?
- How does the tremor impact your daily activities?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For tremor you could track your symptoms over 2-3 days, recording when the tremor is most
  bothersome, ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods if you experience them, and when you take your
  medication.
  Tests
  Further tests are not normally required, unless there is a suspicion of an alternative cause of the
  tremor from the clinical assessment.
  Further treatments
  Having consulted a healthcare professional, they may offer reassurance or further treatment.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your medication if within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
  See extra information below about some medication used for tremor.
- Parkinson’s medication: See our Medication page for more information.
- Anticholinergics (e.g. trihexyphenidyl)
- Beta blockers (e.g. propranolol).
  See extra information below to see some medications that may increase tremors and so may be
  reviewed.
- Medication used for lung conditions (like asthma and COPD), such as salbutamol,
  theophylline
- Medication used for epilepsy, e.g. sodium valproate
- Medication used for mental health problems, e.g. Lithium
- Medication used to supress the immune system, e.g. tacrolimus, ciclosporin
- Medication used in heart disease, e.g. amiodarone
- Levothyroxine.
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service.
- If your tremor is causing difficulty with daily
  activities, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team may refer
  you on to an occupational therapist to help assess and
  decide if you might benefit from additional equipment or
  support.
- If your Parkinson’s specialist has exhausted all
  medication options and the tremor is still impacting
  your daily life a great deal then you may be a candidate for a surgical therapy such as Deep
  Brain Stimulation. If your Parkinson’s specialist team think that is the case they may refer you
  to a specialist centre for further assessment. See Advanced Treatments & Surgical
  Treatments for more information.
  Key messages
- It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a Parkinson’s tremor and other
  causes of tremor at the time of diagnosis.
- Tremor can be increased by stress or anxiety
- Medications for Parkinson’s can help treat tremor

Freezing
Freezing is a sudden feeling that you can’t start or complete a movement. Most people have
"freezing of gait" meaning freezing happens when walking. People describe feeling their feet are glued to
the ground and unable to move, but they’re still able to move their arms. It can happen at the start of a
movement or in the middle of a movement (e.g. when you are starting to walk or in the middle of walking).
Sometimes freezing can happen while eating, writing, or when you are rushing to do something. It is
important to address freezing because it can impact on confidence and can contribute to falls.
What might be causing it?
Freezing is a symptom of Parkinson’s. It often occurs in people who have had the condition for a
long time but it can also occur earlier on. Freezing happens more commonly in "off" (when
medications are not working as well) but can also occur in "on" stages.
Factors that can make freezing more likely are:

- Being in crowded or narrow spaces (e.g. doorways)
- Distractions
- Feeling stressed
  What should I do about it?
  There are things you can try for yourself (see section ‘What can I try for myself?’) but there are
  some situations where you should seek professional help. These include falling a lot or continuing
  to struggle with usual activities after trying the self-help strategies. It is best to seek help from
  your specialist Parkinson’s team or a physiotherapist (which may be through your GP).
  What can I try for myself?
  The best thing to do if you think you can feel yourself freezing is to stop moving and hold on to
  your balance. Freezing can be a frightening feeling, but if you try to keep moving or become
  agitated you may fall.
  There are different techniques that you can try. Some aim to overcome freezing when it happens,
  others aim to prevent it. You may find some work for you and others don’t. It is good to try out
  different strategies and see which suits you best. You might even find your own way to apply the
  principles.
  The broad principles are:
  a) Attention & thinking
- Focus on what you are doing
- Thinking ahead or visualising
  b) Using weight
- ‘Weight shifting’ to free up part of the body
- Marching
  c) ‘Cueing’. This is using a ‘cue’ to keep movement flowing. Different cues can be
  tried: • Visual cues
- Sounds
- Imagine cues.
  Thinking & attention
- Focus in on what you are trying to do.
- Think about putting your heel down first when taking each step.
- Think about big steps.
  ‘Plan method’

1. Pause
2. Think 3 . Plan
   Calm What d o y ou How are you going t o d o i t? 4. Do
   yourself, want to do? Complete
   Work o ut small a chievable
   take a
   the t ask o r
   deep Scan t he a rea steps
   movement
   breath for the e.g. 1 0 s teps t o t he p hone b ooth,
   easiest path
   then 15 to the bench
   Reducing distractions may make this easier.
   ‘Visualisation’

- Athletes and musicians use this to visualize their tasks before performing.
- Imagine the movements for the whole task before starting it. Think about it step by step.
- For example, imagine the steps you need to do to get out of bed over and over until you feel confident
  in each step.
  Using weight

1. Shift all your 2. Count to three or 3. Step forward with say, ‘ready,
   weight onto one the other leg steady, go’
   leg
   Or, rock your head and shoulders side to side to shift weight.
   Marching to prevent freezing:

- Gives rhythm to walking.
- Encourages big steps.
- As you go through narrow spaces, try exaggerating the march even more.
- As you turn, use big purposeful steps like a march, rather than pivoting.
  Cueing
  These can be used both to prevent and overcome
  freezing. a) Visual cues, for example:
- Ask someone to place their foot in front of yours for you to carefully step over. A rolled up
  newspaper or handle of an umbrella work as well, just be careful not to trip on it.
- Use a laser to create a beam of light to follow.
- Prevention: Stick bold tape to the floor in spots you commonly experience freezing. You
  could use a fan shape around corners and between rooms.
- Some equipment has been designed with lasers built in, for example walking sticks or
  frames.
  b) Sound cues, for example:
- Use a metronome app or device.
- Count out loud or to yourself.
- Sing a rhythmic song or rhyme.
- Listen to music with a good beat.
- Prevention: count or sing as you go through doorways or

other spots that trigger you to freeze. Use the momentum
of the rhythm to carry you through.
c) Imagine a cue, for example:

- Imagine a sound (i.e. a beat, metronome or rhythmic music).
- Imagine a line in front of you to step over.

Environment

- Remove rugs or mats that cause you to freeze in your home.
- Remove clutter that makes spaces feel small.

## My Experience

People by affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I’ve got some tricks up my sleeve now. Well, I did a very good CBT course and mindfulness,
and I use a variety of techniques to unfreeze myself. I use counting for its cueing. I think to
myself, I’m going to move on four; I’m going to count one, two, three and four, which is the
cha-cha rhythm: one, two, three, cha-cha-cha…[then move forward]. Or you could target;
you pick a spot the other side of what is your barrier, and you step onto
that, a particular pattern in the carpet.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
“Sometimes she will freeze, and then if there’s a division, like from the carpet onto that
mat, or tiles on the floor, then to get her to step over, tell her to step over that division.
Sometimes I’ve told her to step over something that isn’t there, but just to get the idea of
moving” (20 Carer)
Further assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. Record this in your My Health section to bring to the appointment.
- They might ask how much the freezing occurs and when this happens. This is to see if there is a
  relationship to medication (e.g. If it only occurs during “off” periods or when both “on” and “off”)
  or if there are any triggers.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional see any patterns.
- For 3-5 days you could monitor your “on” and “off” times, freezing episodes, and when you take
  your medication. This will help to identify patterns in your freezing.
  Further treatments
  A healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses)
  may change your medication.
- If freezing happens during “off” periods they may adjust your antiparkinsonian medication.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime
  without speaking with a healthcare professional.
- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) may also help freezing if it is related
  to off periods.
  •
  Referral
- You may be referred to another service. Please be aware there is usually a waiting time before
  that next service will see you.
- You may be referred to physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy who can teach you
  strategies for dealing with freezing. They can also support you to adapt your daily activities or
  environment to manage the symptom better.
  Research is ongoing to look for new ways of managing freezing, including the use of new
  technologies.
  Key messages
- Try out different self-help strategies for freezing to see what suits you. A physiotherapist or
  occupational therapist can help to teach you these.
- Freezing may be linked to “on”/ “off” times and may respond to Parkinson’s medication.
- Freezing can cause falls and injuries. It is important to let your GP, specialist nurse, or
  neurologist know if you are freezing during tasks such as walking and eating.

Balance & Falls Introduction
Falls can be a significant source of concern and stress for some people with Parkinson’s. There are
many things that can be done to help prevent them from happening. Falling over is more common
in Parkinson’s for a number of reasons, but they can also be reasons not related to Parkinson’s.
What might be causing it?
Whether you have Parkinson’s or not, the risk of falls goes up with age. Factors that can make it
more likely are:

- Problems with joints, such as arthritis
- Problems with muscles. This could be from general weakness to a specific muscle disorder.
- Having had previous falls
- Having dementia
- Having depression
- Taking medications that cause drowsiness
- Other health issues, such as infections.
- Problems with your vision
  Symptoms of Parkinson’s that can contribute to falls include:
- Movements being stiffer, slower or smaller. For example, taking smaller steps can cause a
  person to trip. ‘Freezing’ when walking can also be a problem, especially when turning.
- A bent posture can affect balance.
- Involuntary movements (‘dyskinesia’) can change your centre of gravity and affect balance.
- Feeling dizzy, faint, or like your legs are giving way, due to drops in blood pressure.
- Reduced control of balance.
- Sleepiness, low mood or difficulty concentrating
- Problems with sight, such as seeing double.
- Bladder and bowel symptoms that can lead you to rush to get to the toilet.
  There is more information on these on their respective symptom pages.
  Some medicines make the above symptoms worse and this can increase your chance of falling
  over. These symptoms, as well as pain or other health conditions, can lead to lower levels of
  activity. Less activity can lead to weaker muscles and worse balance.
  Other health conditions can increase your risk of falls, such as arthritis or old injuries. Falls can
  also come about because of a new illness, such as a urine infection.
  External factors also contribute to balance and falls:
- Footwear
- Lighting
- The surface – e.g. uneven pavement, narrow steps, loose rugs
- Obstacles – e.g. trailing cables, pets
  What should I do about it?
  There are lots of things you can try yourself to improve your balance and reduce your risk of falling over.
  These symptoms can call for a professional assessment. This is both for the cause(s) and the
  consequences. It might also include an assessment of your home to look at the environment and
  safety measures.
  If you develop new symptoms of imbalance or falls, or have had a rapid change in the pattern of your
  falls you should see your GP as soon as possible.
  If your falls are associated with worsening movement symptoms, like stiffness or slowness of
  movement, or you have had a recent change in your Parkinson’s medication, you should consult
  your Parkinson’s team.
  You should seek help urgently, via your GP or A&E, if:

1. You have had a potentially serious injury, e.g. if you are unable to get off the
   floor.
2. You take blood thinning medication and have had a head injury.
3. The fall was associated with other significant symptoms, for example o Loss of
   consciousness (blacking out) o Palpitations (feeling your heart racing) o Feeling
   breathless o Chest pain o Feeling sweaty or clammy
4. You have a new symptom after the fall: o Drowsiness o Weakness on one side of
   the body o Significant pain
   What can I try for myself?
   There are many things you can do for yourself to improve
   balance, prevent falls and manage the risk surrounding them.
   Keep Active
   It is important to try to stay as active as possible, unless you
   have been specifically advised otherwise. Staying active helps
   you maintain muscle strength and balance so reduces your
   chance of falling over. It is also good for your Parkinson’s and
   general health.
   There are different components to the activity you
   should try to undertake:

- Strength
- Balance
- Flexibility
  In P arkinson’s, s pecific a ttention a lso n eeds t o b e g iven
  to:
- Making big movements
- Carrying out more than one task at a time, known as ‘dual-tasking’.
  Exercises to achieve these need to be tailored to your ability and needs.
  For more on all of these aspects, see the Keeping Active page.
  Tips to prevent falls
- Give yourself time.
- Reduce unnecessary distractions.
- Where possible, it will also help to address other factors that can contribute such as pain,
  tiredness and stress.
- Many falls are associated with drops in blood pressure. There are tips for dealing with this
  on the Dizziness page.
- Ensure you have appropriate footwear. Low heels or flat soles are better, and solid shoes
  with good support are better. Try to avoid unsupportive shoes, such as flip-flops, floppy
  slippers, or high heels.
- Get a sight test – see General Medical Advice page for more information.
  Environment
- Ensure adequate lighting.
- Try to minimise obstacles, like clutter on the floor or trailing cables.
- Place furniture in strategic locations in case you need to use it as support as you move
  around.
- Consider the surface you are walking on – watch out for wet floors or loose rugs.
- Be careful what you lean on – don’t lean on something that might move or come off a wall.
- Consider changing patterned surfaces that make it harder to judge distances, for example
  patterned carpets.
- Consider applying a strip of coloured tape to the edge of steps/stairs to highlight them and
  make it easier to judge the step.
- Make the items you use regularly accessible.
- Consider the use of a Reacher to pick things up.
  Safety
- Recognise your limits.
- Have a back-up plan – how could you get help if you ran into trouble?
- For example, you could keep your mobile phone in your pocket.
- Personal alarms and security systems (telecare) are devices that call for help if you have
  a problem at home.
  Alarms and Security
- There are a wide range of systems available.
- You can buy these yourself, either online or from high
  street shops. Some basic systems may be available
  through Adult Social Care services.
- Basic alarms: can be worn (e.g. on your wrist or as a
  pendant) or placed in the home. When you press the
  alarm they can either make a loud noise to send a signal
  to someone.
- Key safes: these are boxes installed outside your home that hold the key to your home. They
  can be opened using a code. They are used to allow people into your home in an emergency.
- Security systems, for example:
- Devices to track your location so someone could find you if needed.
- Sensors that detect if you fall over.
- More information about these systems is available on the NHS website and the Which? Later
  Life Care website.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I store things I use daily, like medication or towels, between waist and eye-level, so I can avoid
reaching or bending, which can throw me off balance” (Person with Parkinson’s)
“We’ve got buzzers. We’ve got pendants really. It connects to a mainline where they talk to
you through the phone. They just say, “what’s wrong”? They know your name and
everything and then they’ll send a medic or whatever’s needed. It is good. We pay for it, but
it’s worth it. It’s not much.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Further assessment
What we need to get to the bottom of is:

1. What is causing the falls?
2. What is the consequence of the falls?
3. What might be done to reduce the frequency of and impact of falls?
   This is often not a quick process, and you may be referred on to another service for a further
   assessment.
   Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about.
  o
  Description of before, during and after the fall(s). Did you lose consciousness (‘black out’)?
  How did you feel just before the fall? How did you feel after the fall?
- Did someone else see the fall? If so, how did you look before, during or after the fall?
- Any injuries from the fall(s)?
- Any triggers for falls?
- Any other symptoms you have been experiencing?
- About your home environment
- About the risk factors for falls as discussed above.
- If possible, it can be helpful for them to speak to someone else who saw the fall.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional
  look for patterns.
- For balance problems and falls the nature of the diary will depend on
  what you are experiencing.
- If it is does not happen often, it would be best to note just when it
  occurs rather than tracking symptoms all the time. It is helpful
  to note what actually happened (e.g. “I was getting up from bed
  to go to the toilet in the night. It was dark and I tripped over the
  rug in my bedroom”), any other symptoms you experienced (e.g. dizziness), and anything
  you notice about the circumstances (e.g. “I had not slept well last night”).
- If falls are occurring very often (daily or multiple times a day) then a 3-5 day period of monitoring
  may be helpful. This could include symptoms as well as when you take your medication
  and what your food and drink intake has been. It is helpful to record what you were doing
  at the time of each fall (e.g. “I got up from my chair to answer the door”)
  Tests
  Once a health professional has done an assessment, they may need further tests. This could be to
  determine the cause of the fall or to evaluate an injury.
  Further treatments
  Once you have spoken to a healthcare professional, they can help reassure you. They can also look
  into further treatment.
  Treatment for an underlying cause
- This will vary according to the cause, for example:
- If they think it is due to low blood pressure, then they may adjust your medication to treat
  the low blood pressure.
- If they think you have an infection, they may give you antibiotics.
  Falls services
- You may be referred to a falls service.
- A falls service will be run by professionals with different skills working as a team.
- The teams are designed to:
- Assess for a range of factors that can lead to falls, such as balance problems, and
  medication.
- Assess specific risks, such as risks of breaking bones.
- Assess your home environment for hazards.
- Give falls prevention strategies, which will address issues identified and provide
  strength and balance training. These may be offered as a group class.
- The assessment and recommendations will be tailored to you. They aim to promote
  independence and wellbeing.
- They can also recommend equipment or alarm systems if this is needed.
  Physiotherapy & Occupational Therapy
- You may be referred to a physiotherapist or
  occupational therapist. This will likely be if you are not being
  seen in a falls service. In some areas there are specialist teams
  for people with conditions like Parkinson’s.
- See the Who May be Involved page for more
  information about the different professional roles.
- They assess your walking and how you transfer
  between
  positions (like getting up from a chair).
- They will aim to give you tailored strategies and exercises, to help your balance and reduce
  the risk of falls.
- They will also consider your home environment.
- If appropriate, they will advise about: o Walking aids, e.g. walking sticks o
  Equipment or adaptations, e.g. rails o Extra support, e.g. carers o Alarm systems
  They may make recommendations to the Adult Social Care services if this is needed.
  Please see the Practical Advice pages for guidance on daily activities.
  Adult Social Care Services
- They can assess for extra support, requirements for your home and alarm systems if needed.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses)
  may change your medication if they have the expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional
- If you are found to have fragile bones (osteoporosis) so at higher risk of breaking bones you
  may be given medication to treat this
- A decision made about medication is based on weighing up the risks and the gains for the
  individual.
  See extra information below about medications that are linked with a higher risk of falls.
- Parkinson’s medication
- Sedating medication – e.g. diazepam, zopiclone
- Some pain medication – e.g. morphine, oxycodone, gabapentin, amitriptyline
- Medication used for the bladder - Anticholinergic medications – e.g. oxybutynin,
  solifenacin
- Medication for the prostate – alpha blockers e.g. tamsulosin
- Medication used for mood symptoms – e.g. nortriptyline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine (and
  less so: SSRIs e.g. citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine)
- Medication used for psychiatric illness – e.g. chlorpromazine, quetiapine
- Medication used for seizures – e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine (less so valproate)
- Muscle relaxants – e.g. baclofen
- Antihistamines – e.g. chlorphenamine
- Medication used for dizziness – e.g. prochlorperazine, cinnarazine, betahistine
- Medication used for heart or blood pressure: alpha blockers (e.g. doxazosin), diuretic
  medications (e.g. bendroflumethiazide, furosemide, bumetanide, indapamide), ACE-
  inhibitors (e.g. Ramipril, Lisinopril, perindopril, enalapril), ARBs (e.g. losartan,
  candesartan), beta blockers (atenolol, propranolol, bisoprolol), anti-anginals (e.g. GTN,
  ISMN, nicorandil), calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem,
  verapamil), arrhythmia medicines (e.g. digoxin, amiodarone)
- Medication used in dementia (e.g. donepezil, rivastigmine).
  Alexander Technique
- The Alexander Technique is a technique to
  improve posture and movement that can be
  taught. It focuses on balance and posture.
- It can be considered for people with Parkinson’s
  who have issues with movements or balance.
- In some areas this is an NHS service but in some
  areas it is only available privately.
  Other specialist services
  For specific causes of falls you may be referred to a specialist service. For example if your doctor thinks
  I your falls may be a heart problem, you may be referred to a cardiologist.
  Key messages
- Issues with balance and falls are seen in Parkinson’s. They may have other causes, so this does
  warrant a full assessment the first time or if there is a change.
- Assessment may be through your GP, physiotherapist, a local falls service or a specialist.
- Physiotherapists have expertise in helping with walking and balance. They can give advice on ways
  to reduce the risk of falls.

  Dizziness
  Dizziness is often a difficult symptom to describe. It
  can also be difficult to work out the cause. People use
  a range of words to describe how they feel and the
  medical terminology is complicated. Symptoms of
  dizziness can be difficult to distinguish from
  headaches, visual disturbances, or tiredness.
  Although it can be difficult to decide which group dizziness symptoms fit into, there are two main
  types of dizziness.
- Vertigo: a sense of movement when not moving. This is classically described as a spinning
  sensation, but can also be described as feeling like being on a boat or something similar.
  Vertigo originates in the ear, brain or nerves. These are the parts of the body that detect and
  interpret where your body is in space in order to maintain balance.
- Light headedness or feeling faint: This is often trickier to describe. When oxygen to the
  brain is reduced, the body’s natural response is to lie down. This is so that the blood doesn’t
  have to flow against gravity. When blood pressure is very low, the oxygen to the brain is
  reduced so this same principle applies. The body’s desire to lie down is felt in different ways,
  for example:
- Feeling as though your legs give way o Feeling off-balance o
  Feeling faint
- Feeling ‘muzzy’
  Many people experience balance problems or falls for other reasons. See the Balance and Falls
  page for more information.
  What might be causing it?
  Dizziness is a common symptom in people with and without Parkinson’s. The most common
  reason for dizziness in Parkinson’s is changes in the body’s control of blood pressure. ‘Postural
  hypotension’ or ‘orthostatic hypotension’ is when the blood pressure drops on changing from a
  lower position (sitting or lying) to a higher position (standing). This tends to be when people feel
  the dizziness, though there can be a delay.
  Some medications make postural hypotension worse. This includes some Parkinson’s medication,
  as well as medication for high blood pressure and heart disease. Many other conditions can also
  cause drops in blood pressure, for example infections, dehydration, and bleeding.
  Dizziness can be caused by anxiety or panic. Anxiety is more common in
  Parkinson’s; see the Anxiety page for more information.
  Dizziness is seen in a range of other conditions, including inner ear problems (e.g. Benign Paroxysmal
  Positional Vertigo, BPPV) and people with irregular heartbeats.
  Symptoms that are not typical of dizziness related to Parkinson’s include: difficulty in hearing,
  ringing in your ears (tinnitus) and bad headaches.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many lifestyle factors that can improve
  blood pressure fluctuations and dizziness for those
  with postural hypotension. Try the suggestions below
  (see section 'What can I try for myself?'). But if the
  dizziness does not improve or recurs, and is affecting
  your daily life, you should see your GP. If you have new
  symptoms with the dizziness then this should be
  medically assessed.
  Assessment of dizziness is more urgent if it is
  happening very frequently or causing you to fall or lose consciousness.
  What can I try for myself?
  General
- It is important that you do not stop all activity due to your symptoms. Maintaining activity is
  really important. You might need to pause and rest if you get dizzy, but try to stay active as
  much as possible.
- Try to reduce your intake of alcohol as this can make all types of dizziness worse.
- Being well rested reduces symptoms of dizziness.
- Maintaining good hydration improves blood pressure control.
  Safety measures
  These do not change the symptom, but help to minimise the risks:
- Take your time, especially when you change position. Rushing worsens dizziness and increases
  the risk of falling.
- Have something to hold when you change position. For example, make sure there is something
  you can hold on to when you stand up. This will help steady you while your body gets used to
  being upright.
- Extra support. Consider having someone available to help you in higher risk situations, such
  as showering or bathing.
- Do not do anything that could be dangerous while you're dizzy. This includes
  driving, climbing a ladder, and using heavy machinery.
- You must tell DVLA if you have dizziness that is ‘sudden, disabling or recurrent’. See the
  GOV.UK
  website for more details.
  Postural hypotension
- Maintaining good hydration is essential to maintaining your blood pressure.
- Avoid triggers. Situations that will make postural hypotension worse include:
- Hot stuffy environments, like hot baths or
  showers o Eating large meals o Straining (e.g. due
  to constipation) o Standing for long periods of
  time.
- Moving your legs before standing can get blood pumping and improve symptoms. If you have
  to stand for a long time, try shifting the weight between your feet.
- Flight stockings – but caution if you have other circulatory problems. If in doubt, speak with
  your doctor first.
- Take your time on changing position: you should allow extra time
  for your blood pressure to stabilise before walking. For some people
  this is a few seconds, for others it is many minutes.
- Raise the head of your bed by about 15cm (6 inches). You can put
  bricks or heavy books underneath to lift it, or can try using more
  pillows.
- Eat small, frequent meals. Meals with lots of carbohydrates are
  likely to cause a drop in blood pressure. See Eating Well for
  guidance on food groups. Sitting still for a while after eating may also help.
- Increased salt in the diet may help in some cases, but in some circumstances can be harmful.
  Speak with your GP before you try this.
  For more information about blood pressure, including how to measure it, see the General Medical
  Advice page.
  Further Assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance.
  You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about what they might ask about with regard to dizziness.
- Describe the dizziness - e.g. a spinning sensation or feeling lightheaded
- Under what circumstances does it happen / have you noticed any triggers?
- Lifestyle questions - e.g. how much water you drink, alcohol intake?
- Any other symptoms - e.g. difficulty in hearing, ringing in your ears (tinnitus), bad
  headaches or persistent nausea, palpitations, anxiety or panic.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you recall details and help the professional identify patterns.
- How best to track your dizziness will depend on how often it is a problem.
- If it is infrequent, record only when it occurs rather than monitoring it all the time. It is
  helpful to note what you felt, any other symptoms at the time, and the circumstances (e.g.
  “Getting out of bed in the morning”).
- If the dizziness is frequent (daily or multiple times a day) then record what happens over
  a 3- 5 day period. This could include symptoms, when you take your medication and your
  food and drink intake, to look for a pattern.
  Tests
- Most of the time blood pressure is checked and no further tests are needed.
- In some cases, more frequent blood pressure monitoring is required.
- Occasionally, depending on your symptoms, further tests may be done. This could include:
- Blood tests - e.g. to check for anaemia o An ECG (an electrical recording of your heart) o
  A scan of your head or neck (but this is rare).
  Further Treatments
  Your healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment. The
  treatment will depend on the cause of the dizziness.
  Cause: postural Hypotension
- Changes to your medications may help. These changes may be made by your GP or Parkinson’s
  specialist depending on the situation.
- Managing postural hypotension is challenging if you also have high blood pressure. It can be
  a delicate balance.
- Some medication may make postural hypotension worse. These should be reviewed and the
  risks and benefits considered.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
- See extra information below for examples of medication that sometimes
  lower blood pressure.
  o
  Medication used for high blood pressure: alpha blockers (e.g. doxazosin), diuretics (e.g.
  frusemide, bendroflumethiazide), ACE inhibitors (e.g. Ramipril, enalapril), calcium
  channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine)
- Medication used for heart disease: many of the above; beta blockers (e.g. bisoprolol).
  Note beta blockers are also used for anxiety and for tremor in some cases.
- Medication used for Parkinson’s: levodopa, dopamine agonists
- Medication used for bladder symptoms
- Medication used for depression
- If postural hypotension remains a problem despite the above lifestyle measures (see section
  ‘What can I try for myself?’), medication may be tried. These are not suitable for everyone.
  Medication that is sometimes used includes fludrocortisone and midodrine.
- Sometimes special stockings can be fitted that help to support the blood pressure.
  Cause: vertigo (i.e. inner ear or other balance problem)
- A physiotherapist or vestibular specialist may be able to help.
- There may be treatment that is specific to the cause of your vertigo. For example, physical
  manoeuvres for treatment of BPPV.
- If you are referred on, please be aware there is usually a waiting time before the next service
  will see you.
  See our Anxiety and Balance and Falls pages for more information on these symptoms.
  Key Messages
- Make sure to stay hydrated by, for example, drinking more liquids.
- Take your time when changing position (e.g. going from sitting to standing).

  Pain
  Pain may or may not be a problem for you. Pain can be related to Parkinson’s or may be from
  another cause – sometimes it can be difficult to figure out the difference. Many people report
  having had pain before their diagnosis of Parkinson’s and it can mask other symptoms. Pain and
  Parkinson’s is still an area that is being researched.
  There are many approaches to treating pain. So, finding out
  the cause of your pain and addressing it holistically is
  important to make sure the pain is managed effectively.
  Our bodies are a mixture of complex pathways and
  mechanisms, and lots of factors can influence pain.
  What might be causing it?
  Pain that is related to Parkinson’s can be caused by a variety of factors:
- Muscle pain (most common) - muscles feel ‘achy’ and the pain stays in one area.
- Pain from stiffness – can be in a particular muscle or more general.
- Muscle cramps and contractions - commonly happen in legs (e.g. the calves). This can
  happen at any time, but tends to occur overnight. Medication wearing-off can also cause this. See our
  Cramps & Spasms page for more information.
- “Central pain” - pain felt in the body, but no cause can be identified and is therefore thought to
  originate in the brain. As the pain is unexplained, it can be difficult to treat.
- Nerve pain – typically shooting, burning or tingling pain. This can be caused by peripheral neuropathy
  (see the 5 Senses page) but has many causes.
- Pain related to another symptom (e.g. tummy pain from constipation or pain from tremor).
- Tight tendons (or ‘stiffness’) caused by postural changes
  ‘Frozen shoulder’ can affect people with Parkinson’s and can be painful. For more detail, see the
  Stiffness, Slowness & Small Movements page.
  Pain that is not related to Parkinson’s might have a clear cause (e.g. a sore back from gardening),
  or may be caused by other health problems, such as arthritis, old injuries, or postural changes.
  Certain pain related to Parkinson’s tends to be less bothersome when the Parkinson’s medications
  are working well and more bothersome when the Parkinson’s medications wear-off. Pain can also
  be made worse when a person is under physical or emotional stress.
  What can I try for myself?
  Muscle pain
- Simple painkillers. You can buy paracetamol and
  ibuprofen from your local chemist, pharmacy or
  supermarket. Check the packet or with the
  pharmacist that there are no other medical reasons that you shouldn’t take
  them. Do not take more than
  the recommended amount. Ibuprofen is best taken
  with food. Always check that no other medication you are taking also contain
  paracetamol or ibuprofen,
  Freepik.com so as not to take yourself over the recommended daily dose.
- Keeping active is good for preventing pain.
- Gentle stretching may help prevent pain. The stretches themselves should not be
  painful.
  Tip
- Hydration. Some people with Parkinson’s tell us that drinking regularly is helpful.
  Nerve Pain
- Simple painkillers may help (as above).
- Regular, gentle exercise can be helpful.
- Some people find massage and/or a warm heating pad helpful.
  For more information on exercise and stretching, see the Keeping Active page
  When initially beginning any form of exercise, muscles can feel sore or stiff. It is important not to
  overwork them in the beginning; a slow gentle build up will enable tight muscles to adapt and
  relax. If stretches or exercises do cause you a lot of pain, speak with your physiotherapist, GP or
  Parkinson’s specialist team.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself (see section ‘What can I try for myself?’), but there are
  some circumstances where you should seek professional help. These include:
- If you have particular symptoms such as sudden change/loss in bladder/bowel function or
  numbness/weakness in any function. If you experience this, you should contact a healthcare
  professional straight away.
- Any new severe pain – this should be assessed by a professional.
- If you have tried the things below and are still having pain, or the pain is interfering with your daily
  activities. If this is the case, you should see your GP.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“She just saw the doctor and said, “I’ve got this problem with the pains in my shoulders
and down my right side.” And he said, “I’ll make an appointment for you to see the physios.”
And this is what’s come about [..] they give her this exercise sheet which she does before
she settles down at night.” (Carer for someone with Parkinson’s)

- Where are you having the pain: a specific body part, or a general area? Does it spread to
  other areas?
- When you are having the pain: time of day it usually happens, and timing in relation to
  medications?
- Describe the pain: burning, throbbing, aching, pins and needles, etc.
- Does anything make the pain better or worse: heat/massage?
- Do you take any pain medication for it and does it help?
- What medications you are taking [in case it is a side effect or combination of
  medications]
- Does the pain affect any other function, e.g.: bladder/bowels function, or a weakness
  /numbness has developed suddenly in any limbs etc.
- Rate the pain on a scale of 0-10, with 0 being no pain and 10 being the worst. You can
  record if it changes throughout the day with different activities.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and
  Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the
  professional identify patterns.
- You could monitor when the pain is most bothersome,
  recording:
- What it is you feel o What you were doing
  before and when it occurred o Any other
  symptoms happening around that time o When
  you take your medication.
- How long to track for depends on how often the pain is affecting you. If you get pain every day, 3-
  5 days should be enough to see a pattern.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, a healthcare professional may run further tests (e.g. X-rays or
  scans) if the pain is not thought to be related to Parkinson’s.
  Further Treatments
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s
  Specialist Nurses) may change your medication if within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare
  professional.
- See extra information below about some medication used for pain in Parkinson’s.
- Pain killers – e.g. paracetamol, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Opiate medication such as
  codeine may be used (cautiously )
- Parkinson’s medication – e.g. Dopamine agonists, and Levodopa
- Medication that targets nerve pain – e.g. amitriptyline, gabapentin, pregabalin (all
  cautiously)
- Some joint problems respond to injections into the joint (usually a steroid medication
  combined with a local anaesthetic).
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service. There is usually a waiting time before that next service
  will see you.
- Services you may be referred to include: o Physiotherapy or Occupational therapy: If pain limits your
  walking or interferes with daily tasks, you may be referred to these therapy services.
- Pain clinic: In some cases where the pain is very difficult to manage, input is sought from a specialist.
  A pain clinic may be able to offer other medical or psychological treatments.
  Key Messages
- Pain can be a common issue for people with Parkinson’s, and it may be difficult to tell if pain
  is due to Parkinson’s or other causes.
- Regular exercise, massage, stretching, simple painkillers, and Parkinson’s medications (or
  adjustments to Parkinson’s medications) can be helpful for various causes of pain.
- Tracking the symptoms can help your healthcare professional determine the cause.
- Any loss/sudden change to bladder/bowel function or numbness/weakness in any
  movement/function, contact your professional support straight away.

  Restless Legs
  Introduction
  Restless leg syndrome can feel like:
- An irresistible urge to move your legs
- A pins and needles sensation in your legs
- A burning sensation in your legs
  These sensations usually occur in the evening while you
  are relaxing. Moving your legs will likely make them
  immediately feel better, but the sensations will return once they are still again. Because these
  feelings tend to occur or get worse at night, they can disrupt people’s sleeping schedules.
  What might be causing it?
- Restless leg syndrome can be due to Parkinson’s and the low level of dopamine in the brain.
- Non-Parkinson’s causes of restless leg include low iron, reduced kidney function, or
  pregnancy; but most cases of restless leg don’t have a clear cause. It can also run in families.
- Alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and some medications tend to make the symptoms of restless leg
  worse.
  What should I do about it?
  If you have new symptoms of restless leg (as described above), or have never consulted a
  professional about it before, you should speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
  Mild cases of restless leg may be treated with lifestyle changes, but more moderate or severe
  cases of restless leg may require medication. You should speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team
  if restless legs are interfering with your sleep. You should also speak to them if you are not able
  to manage it with lifestyle changes.
  What can I try for myself?
- Leg massage, walking and stretching. See the Keeping
  Active page for tips on stretching.
- Warm or cool compresses on the legs.
- Taking a warm bath in the evening. Make sure you are well
  hydrated first.
- Avoiding alcohol, caffeine, and smoking (particularly in the
  evening, when symptoms tend to be worse).
- Establishing regular sleeping habits.
- Maintaining a cool sleeping space.
  Further Assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance.
  You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- They might ask what the sensations in your legs feel like, when they occur, and what makes them
  feel better.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For restless leg symptoms you could record when you have the feelings in your legs, including how
  long it lasts, for example over the course of a week.
  Tests
  Your GP may check your ferritin or iron levels. This is to see if a low iron level is contributing to
  your symptoms. Very occasionally, if another cause is suspected, they may run further tests. This
  can include other blood tests or tests of the electrical activity in the nerves.
  Further Treatments
  Treating the Cause
  If your iron levels are low:
- You may be asked to eat more iron-
  rich foods, examples include:
- Shellfish, red meat, turkey, ham o Beans,
  iron-enriched breads and cereals o Dark
  green vegetables, raisins, prunes, apricots
- You may be advised to take iron
  tablets.
  Caution: iron tablets can cause constipation.
  See the Bowel Symptoms page if this is a concern.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses)
  may change your medication.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without
  speaking with a healthcare professional.
- In moderate or severe cases of restless leg syndrome, treatment with medication may be
  necessary. See extra information below about medication that may be tried.
- Parkinson’s medication: such as dopamine agonists or levodopa o Medication used
  for nerve pain, such as gabapentin or pregabalin (used cautiously).
- Painkillers, such as codeine, and tramadol
- These medications can cause constipation and other side effects, and must be monitored
  by healthcare professionals
  Key Messages
- Restless leg syndrome can feel like burning, pins and needles, or an irresistible urge to move
  your legs
- Symptoms tend to happen at night or while people are relaxing. Symptoms may interrupt
  sleep.
- It’s important to get your ferritin level checked. This is to make sure a low iron level isn’t
  contributing to your symptoms
- Lifestyle changes and medications are also options for treating the symptoms of Restless Leg
  Syndrome

Cramps & Spasms (Dystonia)
Dystonia is an involuntary muscle contraction (this is different to Dyskinesia which refers to
involuntary movements). Dystonia is caused by incorrect brain signals. Muscles become tighter or
shorter than usual, making them stiff. Dystonia can involve twisting movements or spasms.
Dystonia can feel painful or uncomfortable. Not everyone who has Parkinson’s will experience it.
Dystonia most commonly effects the legs and
feet of someone with Parkinson’s. It can cause
abnormal postures of limbs or digits. People
may notice their toes curling. They may notice
their feet turning in at the ankle. They may feel
or see their big toe sticking up. Dystonia can
also impact the eyelids. It can cause frequent
blinking and an intolerance to light. It can
affect the head and neck, the vocal cords,
and/or the hands.
What might be causing it?
Most people with Parkinson’s who experience dystonia have ‘secondary’ dystonia. This means
they get it as a symptom of their condition or as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medication.
‘Primary’ dystonia is a genetic condition in people without Parkinson’s. This runs in families.
Some people with Parkinson’s notice dystonia when their medication levels are low. This may be
at the end of the day, or in between doses. It could be early in the morning before they have taken
any medications. They may have dystonia when their medication levels are at the highest in their
bodies, but this is less common.
What should I do about it?
There are various strategies you can try for yourself discussed below. You should also routinely
talk to your Parkinson’s specialist team about these symptoms. They may be able to make
medication adjustments to help. If the symptoms are causing difficulties with daily life or sleep
then you may need to speak to the team sooner.
What can I try for myself?

- Some people find pressure, warm compresses or stretching help
- Some people discover ‘sensory tricks.’ This is touching the affected area or a nearby area of the body.
  It can reduce the length or severity of the contraction
- Relaxing techniques like a warm bath, yoga, or massage may help
- Eyelid dystonia is also called blepharospasm. It may respond to: pressure on the eyebrows, lying
  down, or chewing.
  Stretching
- It is best to be guided by your physiotherapist about specific stretches.
- Stretching should feel like a gentle pull on the muscle, not be painful. If you experience pain, speak to
  your physiotherapist, GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
- Work through the different parts of the body. You may wish to pay particular attention to the parts of
  the body where you get cramps or spasms.
- Hold each stretch for 10-30 seconds, keeping it still and steady.
- Breathe slowly in and out during the stretch. Don’t hold your breath.
- Repeat each stretch 3-4 times, with a brief break between.
- Try to make this a routine part of your life, several times per week.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“Sometimes I do, I know when the muscles and everything get stiffer, and what I do, I just massage
myself.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions. You could think about these in advance.
  You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about with regard to cramps and spasms.
  Describe what you experience
  o
- When does it happen?
- Is the problem affected by your Parkinson’s medication?
- How does it impact on your daily activities or sleep?
- Does anything help it/make it worse?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns. It may
  influence medication adjustments. Bring your record to your specialist appointment.
- You could record when the dystonia happens, if you are ‘on’ or ‘off’ when you experience
  dystonia, and when you have taken your medication.
- Usually 3-5 days of tracking will be enough to see patterns.
  Tests
  Tests are rarely required for dystonia.
  Further Treatments
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses)
  may change your medication. Nurses may do this if it is within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional first.
- Changing treatment to manage dystonia may be needed. It will generally be advised by your
  Parkinson’s Specialist team.
- See extra information below about the sorts of adjustments that may be considered.
- Longer-acting medications
- Adjusting medication schedule to smaller, more frequent doses
- Dissolving medications that have a quicker ‘on’ effect. This can help in the morning, if this is
  when dystonia is most difficult
- Non-Parkinson’s medications may also be considered.
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service. Please be aware there is usually a waiting time
  before that next service can see you.
- You may be referred to a physiotherapist. They will address movement problems more
  broadly.
- Sometimes people with severe cramps or spasms are referred to a specialist team. This can
  be for more invasive treatments
- Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections may be considered with a specialist. This is to relax
  muscle groups that are moving excessively.
- Deep brain stimulation (DBS) may also be an option for some patients.
  See Advanced & Surgical Treatments for more information.
  Key Messages
- Cramps or spasms, known as dystonia, are experienced by some people with Parkinson’s.
- Medical treatment depends on when they happen, so a diary can be helpful.

  Saliva Problems
  People with Parkinson’s can get problems with their saliva. Sometimes drooling or dribbling can
  happen. This can cause irritation, infection, or cracks around your mouth. This in turn can make
  talking, laughing, eating or drinking an issue.
  Other people with Parkinson’s may experience dry mouth. This can lead to dental problems, which
  can be unpleasant and also increase the chance of chest infections. It can feel uncomfortable and
  make the breath smell.
  What m ight b e c ausing i t?
  In Parkinson’s, as the movements slow down, so does the
  natural tendency to swallow. If less saliva is swallowed, it can
  pool in the mouth and lead to drooling. This may especially
  happen when people are focussed on doing something else, like
  a hobby or watching TV. Some people may find it hard to seal
  their lips or may have a head-down posture, both of which
  make it harder to control the flow of saliva.
  Other conditions can cause problems with saliva. Either due to
  excess fluid in the mouth or due to weakness in face muscles.
  Problems controlling saliva in Parkinson’s tend to occur over
  time. Sudden new problems are less likely to be Parkinson’s.
  Allergies or infections (like a cold) can lead to excess fluid. The
  symptoms tend
  to be mild and short term. Also, drooling tends to happen when asleep. They tend to cause other
  symptoms too, like sneezing and a runny nose. Weakness of the face can occur for many reasons.
  This includes after a stroke or injury.
  Parkinson's drugs and other drugs can cause a dry mouth. Breathing through the mouth can cause
  a dry mouth. It can happen when dehydrated from smoking, or after surgery, or injury to the face
  or neck.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself. But if your saliva problems don’t improve within
  one month and are troublesome, seek help from your GP or talk to your Parkinson’s specialist
  team.
  If you have white patches in the mouth, or it is painful and red or swollen, see your GP. If you have
  concerns about tooth decay, gum disease, or infections in the mouth then you should consult a
  dentist. Make sure to tell them you have Parkinson’s.
  Note if you have new weakness in the face you should see your GP. Very sudden weakness, occurring
  ‘like the snap of the fingers’, on one side of the body could be a stroke: call for an ambulance, 999.
  What can I try for myself?
  For too much saliva
  Adjustments

- Changing posture to be more upright
- Humming while bent over - keeps lips closed and prevents drooling
  Reminders to Swallow
- Sipping water can help remind you to swallow, and clears your mouth of excess saliva
- Sugar-free sweets or gum can are helpful reminders to swallow (sugar-free to protect teeth)
- There are technologies, such as mobile phone apps, to prompt you to swallow. They use vibration
  or sound alerts. Lip exercises in front of a mirror
- Close your lips tight for a count of four, relax, and then repeat five times
- Stretch lips into a wide smile, hold for a count of four, and relax
- More exercises are available online at Parkinson’s UK o These exercises promote awareness of
  your lips and remind you to hold lips firmly together to hold saliva in
  For dry mouth
  Things you could try:
- Frequent sips of water during the day
- Suck on ice cubes and lollies- but only do this if you
  do not have difficulty swallowing. If you do have
  difficulties swallowing, sucking on ice cubes could
  lead to choking.
- Chew sugar free gum or sugar free sweets
- Use lip balm if your lips are dry
- Brush your teeth twice a day and use alcohol-free mouthwash, to reduce the chance of developing
  tooth decay
- Some people find humidifiers helpful
  Things to avoid:
- Smoking or chewing tobacco
- Reduce alcohol, caffeine and fizzy drink intake
- Alcohol-based mouthwashes

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“If I didn’t dribble it would help, but sucking a polo helps. I tried sugary sweets, but that
didn’t work very well. It got all sticky.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about.
- Any problems swallowing? o Any coughing or feeling of choking on
  food, drink or saliva? o Any other changes in your face or mouth, such as
  a change in your smile? o Any changes in your speech? o Are you
  persistently thirsty and peeing more often? o Do you have dry eyes?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- It is helpful to track your problems with saliva. You can show it to healthcare workers.
- This might reveal a pattern. Like a particular time of day that this is a problem, or a pattern
  with your medications.
- If there is a pattern, tracking your problems and medication for 3 days should reveal it.
  Tests
- Most people do not need further tests.
  Further Treatments
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service.
- For excess saliva, referral might be to:
- Speech and language therapists. They may teach you exercises.
- Physiotherapy or occupational therapy. They may give exercises to help posture or provide
  equipment. E.g. a tilting chair that allows your head to be upright. o Specialist hospital
  services for botulinum injections (Botox), into the salivary gland. This procedure carries some
  small risks, e.g. making the mouth too dry.
- For dry mouth, referral might be to:
- Dieticians can give advice on foods to help.
- Other hospital specialties if a non-Parkinson’s cause is suspected.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your drugs.
  Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare
  professional.
  See extra information about some drugs used for drooling.
- Glycopyrronium bromide
- Hyoscine hydrobromide
- Atropine drops under the tongue
- Note these are unlicensed to use.
  See extra information about drugs that can make drooling worse.
- Drugs used for mental health problems, such as clozapine.
- Drugs used for hallucinations and memory problems, e.g. rivastigmine.
  See extra information about some drugs used for dry mouth.
- Artificial saliva: Gels, sprays, tablets or lozenges. They act like saliva (e.g. Aquoral, Biotène
  Oralbalance gel or Xerotin). Lubricating sprays containing malic acid, physostigmine gel, and
  saliva substitutes containing citric acid appear to be most effective. Note products with citric
  acid should be used in conjunction with fluoride products.
- There is some evidence that herbal products containing chamomile and linseed are
  effective.
- There is some evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) spray.
- Products including toothpaste, mouth rinses, gels, lozenges, and sprays containing xylitol
  appear to be effective and safe
  See extra information about some drugs that can make dry mouth worse.
- Some Parkinson’s drugs. E.g entacapone, rasagiline and selegiline, maybe
  levodopa.
- Drugs for low mood o Drugs for congestion o Drugs for allergy o
  Drugs for urinary symptoms (e.g. solifenacin, oxybutynin, tolterodine) o Water
  tablets (e.g. furosemide).
  Note research does not support effectiveness of acupuncture and electrostimulation for dry
  mouth.
  Key Messages
- Parkinson’s may cause too much saliva, or not enough saliva.
- There are things you can try for both of these.
- Saliva problems in Parkinson’s gets worse over time. Sudden problems with saliva are likely
  due to another cause.

Swallowing Difficulties
Introduction
Some people with Parkinson’s have trouble with swallowing or eating. It can be more difficult to
swallow certain foods, drinks, and medications. Your swallowing can be affected in different ways:

- Difficulty keeping food or drink in your mouth
- Difficulty swallowing food in one go, causing food to remain in your mouth
- Chewing food more slowly
- Trouble opening your mouth
- Coughing or clearing your throat when you are eating or drinking
- Feeling like food is getting stuck as it is going down the tube to your stomach.
  Swallowing problems range from mild to severe and can happen at any time. If you notice any
  swallowing difficulties it is important you speak with your GP or Parkinson's specialist team. They
  can refer you on to specialists for treatment. Untreated swallowing problems can cause more
  serious health conditions, such as chest infections.
  What might be causing it?
  The slowing and stiffening of muscles in Parkinson’s can contribute to swallowing problems.
  Muscles involved in chewing and swallowing (e.g. muscles in the face, jaw, tongue, and throat)
  can become less efficient and powerful. People with Parkinson’s can experience a dry mouth,
  tiredness, or difficulties concentrating at meal times. These can all make swallowing more
  challenging. Also, problems moving your arm or hand (for example, due to tremor) can make it
  harder to guide food into your mouth.
  Other medical issues can cause swallowing difficulties. These include weakness in muscles of the
  face or throat, and blockages or narrowing of the throat or gullet. Weakness of the face can
  happen for many reasons, for example after a stroke or injury. Other reasons for swallowing
  difficulties include poor fitting dentures, and tooth or gum health issues.
  Swallowing difficulties in Parkinson’s tends to happen gradually. Sudden problems are likely to be
  related to other causes. A professional assessment is often needed to identify the root cause.
  What should I do about it?
  There are things you can try to make swallowing easier. However it is very important to tell your
  GP or Parkinson’s specialist team if you have difficulty swallowing food, drinks or medication. They
  will need to assess the cause of your difficulties, particularly if they are worsening. This is because
  swallowing problems can increase the risk of more serious problems, like choking or chest
  infections.
  If you have new weakness in your face you should consult your GP. Very sudden weakness,
  occurring ‘like the snap of the fingers’, on one side of the body could be a stroke. If this is the case,
  call 999 for an ambulance.
  What can I try for myself?

## Planning ahead

- Plan meals for when your medication is working
- Plan meals for when you are less tired - this may mean moving your main meal to lunchtime
- If you wear dentures, make sure they fit comfortably – see your dentist if needed
  Medication adjustments
  If medications feel like they are getting stuck, talk with your Parkinson’s specialist team and/or
  pharmacist. There may be a version available that is easier to swallow.
- Some pills can be split in half, crushed, sprinkled on yoghurt or dissolved in the mouth o Anything
  that is “XR” (extended release) or “CR” (continuous release) should not be crushed
- Check whether it is safe to crush or split tablets by discussing with your Parkinson’s specialist team or
  pharmacist.
  Meal adjustments
  If food is getting too cold while you are eating or
  you are feeling full too quickly, consider:
- Smaller, more frequent meals and snacks
- Food that is easier to eat (e.g. softer foods
  such as mashed potatoes and bananas)
- Heated plates to keep food warm for longer
- Smaller portions and reheat a second portion if
  needed
  While eating
- Take your time and eat in a quiet, comfortable place without distractions
- Try smaller mouthfuls
- Avoid taking another mouthful until you’ve cleared your mouth and throat
  Drinking
- A speech and language therapist can suggest a suitable straw for you to use. This is important as if
  they are not suitable liquid is more likely to go ‘down the wrong pipe’ and into your lungs instead of
  into your stomach.
- Refill your cup or glass when it’s half empty, so you don’t have to tilt your head back to drink.
  Tilting your head back can make food or drink go down the wrong way.
- Very cold liquids can encourage swallowing – try drinking them first thing, before breakfast or with a
  meal
  Swallowing tip:
  When swallowing food or drink, following the process below step by step can help:

1. Take a small mouthful of food or drink
2. Close your lips
3. Chew well
4. Take a deliberate swallow. Try to squeeze hard with all the muscles in your mouth and throat

- this will push food down to your stomach and stop it getting stuck in your throat

5. Swallow again to make sure all the food or drink has gone
6. Try licking round the mouth with your tongue to check all the food has gone
7. Repeat steps until you are finished eating or drinking

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“Things like chilli con carne, spaghetti Bolognese because they’re not big pieces of meat.
But like if he’s got a chicken breast and when you cut things up … sloppier foods are
obviously better than, you know, chunky foods”. (Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. Record this in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below for things they might ask about.
- Are you having problems swallowing food, liquids, or tablets (or a combination of
  these)?
- Have you had any unintentional weight loss?
- Do you have pain when swallowing?
- Has your voice changed?
- Do you have heartburn, nausea or vomiting?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and
  Activity Tracker
- It can be helpful to track your swallowing problems for
  3 days to show healthcare professionals. This will help
  them identify any patterns.
- Record when it happens, what types of foods or drinks
  are difficult to swallow, any other issues you are having
  around swallowing, and when you take your medications.
  Tests
- Most cases do not need further tests.
- In other cases, depending on their assessment, your healthcare professional
  may recommend tests such as a blood test or camera test to look at your food pipe (this is called
  an endoscopy).
  Further Treatments
  Medication
- If the swallowing difficulties happen when your Parkinson's medication has worn off, then changes
  to your medication regimen may help. Your Parkinson’s specialist team can advise on this.
- Sedating medications can make swallowing problems worse.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare
  professional.
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service.
- Typical referrals for swallowing problems might include:
- Speech and language therapists – assess and work with people with swallowing difficulties,
  teaching useful techniques and exercises. They also advise on the consistency of food that is
  safe to swallow and assess what type of straw is best to use.
- Occupational therapists - can provide people with equipment to help them eat and drink.
- Dieticians – review people who are very underweight and help improve diets by looking at the
  combination of food groups.
- Physiotherapist - can provide help with posture while eating.
- Depending on the assessment, you may be referred to other hospital specialities (e.g. Ear Nose
  and Throat specialists or Gastroenterologists) particularly if a non-Parkinson’s cause is
  suspected.
  If you are having significant and progressive difficulties swallowing, there is more information
  on the
  Progression of Symptoms page.
  Key Messages
- Problems with swallowing tablets, liquid, or food can happen at any time during Parkinson’s.
- Speak with your GP or healthcare professional as soon as you notice any difficulty swallowing,
  or if it gets significantly worse, as it may need further assessment.

Speech Difficulties
Speech difficulties are common in Parkinson’s. They include a range of symptoms. But not
everyone with Parkinson’s will have the issues discussed in this section. Problems with speech include:
quiet, slurred, hoarse-sounding voice; monotone; and difficulty with tongue and lip movements. It may feel
like you are wearing a mask.
What might be causing speech problems?
Parkinson’s causes changes in the brain. This leads to
movements becoming smaller and less forceful. This can
impact your voice. The condition can affect how the brain
thinks. It affect your thought processes, which may slow
down. Or you may find it hard to find the right word to say.
Many people with Parkinson’s don’t know they are
speaking quietly.
There are reasons other than Parkinson’s that cause
changes in speech. It could be something within the mouth,
throat, or
jaw (e.g. poorly fitting dentures or a throat infection). Other medical conditions affecting the brain
can also cause speech problems (for example, a stroke which has caused weakness on one side of
the face or affected the brain pathways for finding words). Speech changes in Parkinson’s tends
to occur gradually. Sudden problems are less likely to be related to Parkinson’s.
What should I do about it?
There are things you can do yourself to improve your speech. If symptoms are progressing and
affecting your life, or you are worried about related symptoms, see your GP. You should discuss
your concerns with your Parkinson’s specialist team at your next appointment.
If you have a new hoarse voice that has lasted more than three weeks you should see your GP.
Very sudden changes in speech, usually with weakness of one side of the face, could be a stroke.
In this case, call for an ambulance using 999. Very sudden means occurring like a ‘snap of the
fingers’.
What can I try for myself?
Speech strategies

- Try to relax by making sure you’re sitting or standing comfortably before speaking, with a posture
  that helps you take in a good breath.
- Every time you speak, imagine you’re speaking to the people at the back of a big room. This will help
  you speak clearly and at the right volume.
- Try to make each word as clear as possible, and speak slowly.
- You may find it useful to practise saying things in a simpler way. You can keep sentences short and
  stress key words.
  Getting speech exercises into everyday life
  It is important you practise the following with a clear voice, as rehearsing with a hoarse voice will
  cause more problems. A hoarse voice should clear if you talk louder.
- Singing: A hobby that may be a social and fun way to increase your confidence in your voice o
  Singing exercises for your voice and breathing muscles may help your speaking voice.
- There are singing classes all over the UK for people with Parkinson’s - some are run by Parkinson’s
  UK local groups. Or perhaps just singing in the shower.
- Socialising: This gives you opportunities to practise your speech and improve confidence. See
  our Social & Spiritual Life page for more tips.
- Read out loud: Whether it is stories, poetry or the news, try reading it out loud rather than in
  your head to exercise your speech.
- Apps: Some people use an app on their phone or computer to show how many decibels they use
  when speaking. This can help you realise how quiet or loud you are talking. Normal conversation
  is around 60 – 70 decibels. If you are interested in this ask your therapist, who may be able to
  advise you further.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I had one gentleman who loved telling stories to his grandchildren. So I said, Well why
don’t you record them and, if you record it loud enough, then that’s your exercise.” (Speech
& Language Therapist)
Further assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance.
  Record this in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about:
- Do you have problems swallowing food, drink or medicines?
- Do you have new weakness in your arms or legs?
- Have you had any unintentional weight loss?
- Do you have any concerns about your memory?
- Do you have a sore throat?
- Can you hear as well as you used to?
- Lifestyle: smoking and alcohol
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For speech problems you could record: o When it is most problematic, and when it is at its
  best; o what you are doing at the time; and o when you have taken your medication, to see
  if there is a relationship.
- You do not need to endlessly track your symptoms: 3-5 days should be plenty to look for a
  pattern.
  Tests
  Most cases do not need further tests. Depending on the healthcare professional’s assessment,
  they may carry out blood tests, a scan of your head or neck, or a camera test to look at your throat
  and vocal cords.
  Further Treatments
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service.
- Referral might be to:
- Speech and language therapists. They assess and advise on speech. In particular, they can
  help with voice, speech clarity, and volume. See them early if your Parkinson’s causes any
  changes in your speech.
- Physiotherapists. They may help with stiffness and strength. They can help you to control
  body language. This is a key component of communication.
- You may be referred to other hospital specialities (e.g. Ear Nose and Throat specialists) if
  a non-Parkinson’s cause is suspected.
  Medication
- Doctors and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your drugs.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
- Parkinson’s drugs (e.g. levodopa) may help your speech.
- Response to Parkinson's drugs changes over time. For example, your voice may be stronger
  when the drugs are working well and softer or weaker when your drugs are not working well.
- Changes to your Parkinson’s drugs may give you better control over speech problems.
- See Variability of Symptoms for more information about these changes in your speech and
  other symptoms.
  Key messages
- Parkinson's can cause speech problems but is not the only cause. Discuss with your GP if you are
  unsure what is causing changes in your speech.
- See a Speech and language therapist as early as possible. They can provide techniques and exercises
  to help improve your speech.

Sexual Function
Sexual problems can happen with Parkinson’s, but not everyone will experience these. Some
people notice changes physically or emotionally, or with sexual drive.
Many people do not feel comfortable talking about sex, meaning sexual
problems may be missed and not addressed.
What might be causing it?
At times, it is completely normal to have issues with sex. Different factors can influence it,
including tiredness and mood. Normal ageing also causes physical changes that affect the ability
to have or enjoy sex. After the menopause women have lower oestrogen levels. This can cause
less lubrication and sometimes the lining of the vagina can become sensitive or inflamed. This can
make sex painful. Health conditions and medicines can affect sexual function in different ways,
such as pain from arthritis or pelvic problems after childbirth. Diabetes, heart disease, smoking
and excess alcohol can also lead to sexual difficulties.
Parkinson’s can impact on a person’s sex life in various ways…

- Movement problems (e.g. slowed movements or difficulties coordinating movements).
- Fatigue can lower your sex drive (libido).
- Bladder or bowel problems may make you or your partner nervous about engaging in sexual
  activity.
- Medication: some medications (e.g. those used to treat depression) can impact sexual desire,
  arousal levels, and ability to orgasm.
- Reduced sex drive (libido) can occur as a result of the psychological and emotional impact of
  managing a long-term condition or as a direct result of Parkinson’s. Tiredness and depression,
  which are common in Parkinson’s, can also reduce sex drive.
- Reduced arousal and orgasm: Parkinson’s can affect the body’s sexual function.
- Confidence.
  Some Parkinson’s medicines (e.g. dopamine agonists) can cause ‘hypersexuality’. This is a marked
  increase in sexual interest, arousal, and behaviour. It might mean having more sexual thoughts or
  desire for different sexual practices. See the Impulsive Behaviours page for more information.
  What should I do about it?
  At times, issues with sexual function are normal and may improve on their own. But if they don’t,
  there are things you can try that might help (see section ‘What can I try for myself?’).
  If the problems are more frequent and bother you, talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
  Many people are embarrassed by talking about sex - but remember these conversations are
  private and confidential. There are possible changes that can be made to medication that may
  improve your symptoms so do not be afraid to talk about it.
  Hypersexuality
  If very mild, some couples may feel happy about the increase in sexual activity. But if
  sexual desires feel out of control, out of character or cause noticeable changes in behaviour then
  this should be addressed. Speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team urgently if this is the case. For
  more information, see the Impulsive Behaviours page.
  What can I try for myself?
  Movement problems
- Some sexual positions might be easier than others.
- Try different times of the day. Ease of movement can change during the day and in response
  to medication, so you may find some times are better for you than others.
  For more information on movement problems, see our Involuntary Movement page.
  Fatigue
  It may help to try being intimate or having sex at a different
  time of day or when you have increased energy levels.
  For more information, see our Tiredness & Fatigue page.
  Bladder and bowel problems
- For urinary incontinence: you could try going to
  the toilet before having sex.
- For bowel incontinence: you could try using an enema before sex, or an anal plug to stop
  leakage.
  For more advice on bladder and bowel issues, see Urinary Symptoms and Bowel Symptoms pages.
  Lowered sex drive
- If you are feeling low in mood, anxious or tired, see the symptom pages for each of these for
  more advice.
- Other things you and your partner may wish to try to increase sexual desire:
- Relax in the bath together o Have sensual massages o Buy new lingerie or sex toys,
  watch an arousing video, or read erotic stories to each other.
- It is important to agree beforehand with your partner that the goal is to become closer and
  enjoy time together – the result may be sex but it may not. This will take any pressure off and
  help to create an environment where increased sexual drive can happen more naturally.
  Problems with sexual arousal and vaginal dryness
- Consider any emotional factors (e.g. stress or tensions in the relationship) that could be
  addressed.
- Try a change in routine. For example, having sex in the morning when you have more energy
  instead of in the evening.
- Using sexual aids, such as a vibrator, to increase stimulation.
- Taking the time to get the mood right and be sensual with each other.
- Men: problems with sexual arousal may mean difficulty getting an erection or losing an
  erection too soon. This is known as Erectile Dysfunction. It is common in men of all ages but
  increases with age. There are potential treatments that your GP may prescribe, so speak with
  your GP.
- Women: vaginal dryness can be painful. You can buy a range of vaginal lubricants and
  moisturisers from the chemist. If these don’t help, your GP might prescribe oestrogen
  replacement cream, or could discuss Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT).
  Problems with orgasm
- Try not to worry.
- Worrying about orgasming can make it happen too quickly or not at all.
- Agree with your partner that you’ll enjoy the time being intimate with each other. This
  means it won’t matter as much if one of you doesn’t reach orgasm.
- Learn what you enjoy.
- Explore what you find pleasurable, either with a partner or by masturbation.
- Try to relax into the sensations you have. Feeling ashamed or embarrassed makes it more
  difficult to achieve orgasm.
- Sex aids (e.g. vibrators and vacuum devices) can help with stimulation and orgasm.
- Pelvic floor exercises. o For women, pelvic floor exercises can help to increase awareness of
  pelvic floor contractions and improve pelvic tone. These can both help with reaching orgasm.
- If you find pelvic floor exercises challenging a physiotherapist, nurse, or GP can offer advice.
  If problems persist, seek professional help (see section ‘Further treatments’).
  Further treatments
- Speak to a healthcare professional (e.g. GP, specialist, Parkinson’s nurse).
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in
  advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below for things they might ask about sexual function.
- When the problem started
- How much response you have to stimulation.
- Times of the day when problems occur.
- Does the problem occur at a time when the medication feels less effective – “off” times?
  Medication
- Changes to Parkinson’s or other medication may improve your symptoms. These changes would
  most likely be made by your Parkinson’s specialist team.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
- Erectile dysfunction: Possible treatment options include… o Tablets (e.g. Viagra/Cialis/Levitra) o
  Self-injection or pessary. This is where a drug is injected into the penis, or inserted in the end of
  the penis as a pessary, to produce an erection.
- Vaginal dryness or pain: possible treatment options include… o Vaginal lubricants o Hormonal
  treatments (for example, Hormone Replacement Therapy).
- Anaesthetic gels
  Therapy
- Relationship counselling. Counsellors can work with couples and individuals (meaning you can
  go alone if you’re single or if your partner does not wish to join).
- Ask your GP for services available in your area.
- Contact your local Relate centre. Visit their website to find your nearest Relate and give
  them a call. You can find contact details in our More Information section.
- Counselling and psychotherapy for
  sexual problems. Counselling or psychotherapy
  may help you to talk openly about any sexual
  problems you are having. They can also support
  you to find ways of making helpful changes.
- Ask your GP for services available in your local
  area.
- Psychosexual therapy: A psychosexual therapist is
  trained in all aspects of sex and can help you to understand the effects of medication and health
  conditions on sex. o You can see a psychosexual therapist on your own or as a couple.
- Ask your GP for services available in your local area.
  Devices and Surgery
  Other treatments for erectile dysfunction:
- Vacuum pump device. This is an alternative to medication and is put around the penis to
  produce an erection.
- Surgery. Usually only used as a last resort, a penile prosthesis can be implanted.
  It is best to discuss your concerns and options with your GP in the first instance.
  Key messages
- Parkinson’s can affect sexual function. This might be due to the physical effects of the
  condition, emotional changes, or as a side effect of medication.
- There are a number of things you can try to help improve sexual function. But if you continue
  to have problems then you should seek help and advice.
- Treatments offered by healthcare professionals include talking therapies and medication
  changes.

Skin Conditions
Introduction
Skin conditions affect many people across the population.
Conditions that can be more common in people with
Parkinson’s are:

- Oily skin
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis: areas of the skin become red, itchy,
  and sore. The skin can peel or flake and can develop thick
  crusts or scales.
- Oily skin
- Wounds or ulcers from delayed healing or from pressure on
  a particular part of the body
- Abnormal moles
  What might be causing it?
  Oily skin
- The skin produces an oily substance called sebum, which protects the skin and keeps it supple.
- People with Parkinson’s may produce more sebum than normal, which can make the face and
  scalp oily and shiny.
  Seborrhoeic dermatitis
- No one knows for sure what causes seborrheic dermatitis, but it’s thought that a type of yeast
  found on the skin may play a part.
- It is not caused by poor personal hygiene.
- It is not known for sure why seborrheic dermatitis is more common in people with Parkinson’s.
  It may be that people with Parkinson’s produce more sebum than normal.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in men overall. This is likely a result of male hormones
  increasing sebum production.
  Wounds & ulcers
- People with Parkinson’s can have ‘peripheral neuropathy’. This causes decreased sensation in
  the extremities. See the 5 Senses page for more information.
- Decreased sensation may mean an injury, or infection in a body part like the foot takes longer
  to detect.
- Healing from an injury may take longer with age, poor nutrition, or other health conditions
  Prolonged pressure through an area of skin can cause damage. This is more likely in people who find
  moving around difficult.
  Abnormal moles and Parkinson’s
- Some research studies have shown that people with Parkinson’s have a slightly higher risk of
  developing abnormal moles or melanoma. People with melanoma have a greater risk of
  developing Parkinson’s.
- The exact link has not been discovered, just a connection between the two for now.
- Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. One of the main causes of melanoma is exposure to too much
  ultraviolet light in sunlight. About 16,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each
  year. There is more information available on the NHS website:
  www.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer
  All of these skin issues are seen in people who don’t have Parkinson’s as well. And people with
  Parkinson’s can also get skin conditions that are completely unrelated to their Parkinson’s. Wounds
  and ulcers are more common in people who have decreased sensation for other medical reasons. An
  example of this would be those with diabetes.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself as below, but there are some circumstances where you should
  seek professional help.
  Make a GP appointment as soon as possible if:
- You have an area of your skin with a wound that isn’t healing properly.
- You have a crusting or roughened spot/raised area or rash that isn’t healing or is getting larger
- You have a mole that concerns you or has recently changed. Features to look out for are: large
  size (5mm or more in diameter), irregular edges, multi-coloured, changing, or is asymmetric –
  for example is lop-sided.
  The other skin conditions discussed here are not urgent, but if bothering you then make a routine GP
  appointment.
  What can I try for myself?
  Seborrhoeic dermatitis
  •
  •
- Wash your hair and beard with ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulphide, or coal tar
  shampoo. These are available from local pharmacies. See the ‘Further treatments’ section below
  for other treatments.
- For hard-to-remove crusts or scales on the scalp
  and/or beard:
- Rub olive or mineral oil into the affected area a few hours
  before washing o Or use a de-scaling agent containing
  ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulphide, or coal tar.
  These are available from local pharmacies.
- For scalp and/or beard maintenance: shampoos
  containing tea tree oil used regularly may be helpful
- For eyelids: Clean them daily with cotton buds moistened with baby shampoo
- Avoid irritants on face and body.
  Oily skin
- Wash your face with a mild soap twice daily in warm water and rinse in cool water.
- If you use make-up and moisturisers:
- Try using water-based gels instead of oil-based creams.
- Avoid cosmetic products that contain alcohol, or that irritate your skin.
- Speak to your pharmacist or GP for more advice on suitable products.

Wounds & ulcers

- Keep skin clean and dry: particular attention is needed for skin folds and between the toes.
- Check the entire body for any wounds. This is especially in areas of the body with decreased sensation:
- Check to make sure the skin is intact.
- If there are any spots where skin has broken down, continue to regularly check any small

injuries for healing or infection.

- Pain, bad smell, fluid leakage, swelling, or increasing size are all signs that a wound is not
  healing properly.
- Change your position regularly in chairs and in bed. This is so that you are not in the same position for
  many hours per day:
- Staying in the same position can lead to pressure ulcers. These are wounds from pressure
  being applied to the same area of the body.
  Abnormal moles
  Check moles regularly (monthly), looking for any changes. You can ask someone else to check or
  photograph moles on your back.
  You should be particularly careful if you have:
- had a lot of sun exposure or sun burn in your life o a lot of moles or freckles o a skin type that
  does not tan easily o red or blonde hair and/or blue eyes o a close relative has had melanoma.
- Features to look out for in your moles are: o Larger size (More than 5mm diameter) o Irregular edges o
  Multi-coloured o Asymmetric (lop-sided) o Changing
- If a mole is changing or you have any concerns about its appearance it should be reviewed by your GP.
  If you are not sure if a mole is changing, you could take a photo of it for comparison.
- Be careful with sun exposure. Some sun exposure is good and helps your body make vitamin D. However
  too much sun exposure increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancer. Finding the balance can be
  tricky. There is no definitive recommendation for the amount of time that should be spent in the sun.
- See the Eating Well page for dietary information about Vitamin D.
- See extra information below about safe sun exposure: [https://www.nh](https://www.nh)s.uk/live-well/healthy-
  body/sunscreen-and-sun-safety/
- Even if it is cool or cloudy, it is possible to get a sunburn.
- Do not rely on sunscreen alone to protect yourself getting sun damage. Wear suitable
  clothing and spend time in the shade when the sun's at its hottest. This is 11am to 3pm in
  the UK from March to October
- There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan from sunlight.
- Getting a tan provides little protection against later exposure to sunlight. The resulting skin
  damage outweighs any later protective effect.
- Windows block some of the sunlight. Sunlight shining through a window pane will not be
  enough for your body to make vitamin D.
- It is not possible to get enough vitamin D from sunlight between October and March in the
  UK.
- Sun protection: this can be achieved by covering skin with clothing, seeking shade and applying
  sunscreen. Sun screen is an additional protection rather than an alternative to covering up. See extra
  information below about sunscreen recommendations.
- Sunscreen must be applied liberally, carefully and repeatedly on exposed skin.
  •
  •
- UVA in a circle logo indicates that a sunscreen meets the minimum standards for UVA
  protection. You should use a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 to protect against UVB.
  Further Assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask you more questions. So you could think about these in
  advance. You could record it in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- The questions will relate to your particular skin issue. They will generally cover details about what
  the problem is, when it occurred, how it has changed over time, whether you’ve had it before and
  what you have tried.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you to recall the details.
- For skin issues you could record when you notice an issue. Also note the details of it. Then check
  again a few weeks later and see if it has changed.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, sometimes further tests are needed. For some skin conditions the
  test is a biopsy. This is where a sample of the skin or mole is taken to examine it under a microscope.
  Further treatments
  Medication
- Your GP or pharmacist may be able to recommend medicated creams or shampoos for
  seborrheic dermatitis if needed. Many of these are available both on prescription and over the
  counter.
- See extra information below about medicinal products that may be recommended for
  seborrheic dermatitis:
- For skin (face, body, scalp): ketoconazole cream, mild steroid cream, or creams with a
  combination of anti-fungal medicine and steroid. Note these should only be used short term.
- For hair (head or beard): ketoconazole shampoo, and selenium sulphide shampoo.
- If a wound is thought to be infected, you may require antibiotics.
  Referral
  You may be referred on to another service.
  If skin cancer is suspected, you will be referred to a skin specialist: a dermatologist. The appointment
  should be within a couple of weeks.
- Severe uncontrolled seborrheic dermatitis or where your doctor is uncertain about the diagnosis
  sometimes warrants referral to a dermatologist.
- Long term wounds may require regular nursing review. This will either via your GP practice nurse
  or the district nursing services if you are unable to get to appointments.
  Key Messages
- People with Parkinson’s may have skin conditions that can be common in people without Parkinson’s
  too
- Skin issues that are more common in Parkinson’s include: oily skin, seborrheic dermatitis, wounds &
  ulcers, and abnormal moles
- If you have decreased feeling or sensation in any area of your body, be sure to check there
  regularly (every time you bathe) for any cuts or wounds that aren’t healing properly

Sweating Difficulties
Sweating is normal and helps your body regulate its temperature. Some people with Parkinson’s may
have problems with sweating. They may experience too much sweat being produced, which is called
hyperhidrosis. Alternatively, they may experience not enough sweat being produced, which is called
hypohidrosis. Underproduction of sweat can cause overheating. Because people with Parkinson’s can
also have a decreased sense of smell, they might not be aware of body odours caused by excessive
sweating.
What might be causing it?
The system that regulates many automatic responses of the body (known as the autonomic nervous
system) may be impacted by Parkinson’s. This includes sweat production. Sweating too much
This can occur in Parkinson’s for example:

- When Parkinson’s medications are starting to wear
  off
- Overnight while sleeping - people may experience drenching
  night sweats
- When Parkinson’s medications are working their best
- especially if someone is experiencing dyskinesias
  (uncontrollable muscle movements)
- As a side effect of Parkinson’s medications
  Non-Parkinson’s causes of sweating too much include:
- ‘Primary hyperhidrosis’: This is a life-long condition of excess sweating with no obvious cause. This can
  be all over your body, or certain areas such as your armpits, hands, feet and face. This can run in families.
- Menopause
- Anxiety
- Medical conditions: Diabetes, obesity, heart disease, thyroid disease, infections and others
- Side effect of some medication and supplements
  Sweating too little
  This can occur in Parkinson’s for example:
- As a side effect of medication.
  Due to the Parkinson’s itself. You may notice it:
- In situations where sweat is needed in order to cool the body in order to not overheat – for
  example in saunas, in hot tubs, or extremely warm environments
  •
  •
- In the hands and feet; other body parts may then sweat more to
  compensate
  What should I do about it?
  Excessive sweating can be very challenging to deal with. There are some
  suggestions for ways to manage it below. If sweating is still very bothersome,
  despite having tried these things regularly for a month or so, discuss with your GP
  or Parkinson’s specialist team. You should seek help more urgently if you are not
  producing sweat and feeling faint or dizzy in warm situations.
  What can I try for myself?
  Sweating too much
- If possible, identify any foods or drinks that trigger
  sweating and avoid them o Common triggers include:
  spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine
- Use an antiperspirant frequently. Antiperspirants are
  different than deodorants: deodorants stop smells,
  antiperspirants stop sweat
- Avoid clothing made from nylon and non-breathable
  materials
- Wear white or black clothes as these help to minimise the signs of sweating
- Dress shields (also known as armpit or sweat shields) absorb sweat and protect your
  clothes
- Wear socks made of cotton or natural fibres, and change socks more frequently, e.g.
  twice a day
- Consider wearing special soles or sports socks designed to absorb moisture
- Wear leather shoes and change them (or take them off) often
- Drink lots of water to replace lost fluids and prevent dehydration
  Sweating too little
- Avoid very hot environments such as hot tubs, saunas or direct sun in hot
  environments • Wear light clothes
- Don’t over exert yourself with exercise
  Further assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about
  these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the
  appointment.
- They might ask about when the problem occurs, and if there are any triggers and any
  related symptoms. These might be changes in weight, changes in bowels, pain, or
  symptoms of infection.
  Ensure you tell them if you have had any times when you have fainted. They
  may ask when the problem started, and things you have tried already to help.
  Track your symptoms in My Tracker in your
  manual
- This can help you to recall the details of when
  sweating is a problem for you, and help the
  professional identify patterns.
- Perhaps for 3 days record when the problem occurs and what
  you are doing at the time. Also record whether you have any other
  symptoms at the time and when you have taken your medication.
  Tests
  If your healthcare professional suspects a non-Parkinson’s cause of sweating they
  may arrange some further tests. These may be, for example, to check your thyroid
  hormone levels.
  Further Treatments
  Medication
- There is no tablet that can be given to fix sweating problems but some medication
  changes may improve the situation.
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your medication if within their expertise.
  Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking
  with a healthcare professional.
  See extra information below about medication that can contribute to sweating
  too much
  •
  •
- Levodopa o Zinc supplements o Some antidepressant medication
  (SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. nortriptyline) o Some
  medication used for memory and thinking problems (cholinesterase
  inhibitors) o Some pain killers (opioids)
  See extra information below about medication that can contribute to sweating
  too little
- Anticholinergic medications used for Parkinson’s or bladder problems
  can sometimes cause decreased sweating, e.g. oxybutynin,
  solifenacin, tolterodine, trihexyphenidyl. o Some antidepressant
  medication (tricyclic antidepressants)
- Some medication used for glaucoma (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors
  e.g. acetazolamide, brinzolamide)
- If the sweating is triggered by dyskinesia (involuntary movements), then a change
  to your Parkinson’s medication regime may be possible to improve control of these.
- Sometimes people just need a medication change during hot weather.
  Referral
- If your sweating is severe, limiting your functioning and does not improve with
  medication changes or the measures listed above, you may be referred on to
  another service (e.g. a dermatologist). They can sometimes recommend
  treatments such as Iontophoresis.
  Iontophoresis involves blocking sweat glands in affected areas of skin by passing a
  weak electric current through water or a wet pad.
- In very severe cases botox (botulinum toxin) injections may be considered to
  reduce excessive sweating. This usually requires referral to a specialist, and the
  availability on the NHS varies by area. The injections cause a temporary change so
  they need to be repeated long term for the effect to continue.
  Key Messages
- People with Parkinson’s may experience changes with their sweat, either excess or
  insufficient
- Management of sweating difficulties are mostly lifestyle changes. It is also considering
  how medications may be impacting the issue
  If you have any tips please tell a member of the study team or email

Leg or Ankle Swelling
Leg or ankle swelling can commonly occur in people with Parkinson’s. Extra fluid
from around the body can settle in the ankles or lower legs. This can be
uncomfortable to walk with, make the skin feel tight, legs feel heavy or shoes feel
tight. This extra fluid is known as oedema. Muscle movements in the legs help to
push some of the fluid back around the body.
•
•
What m ight b e c ausing i t? Sometimes swelling gets better
overnight and then worse when
you are up, sitting and moving
around during the day. This is called
postural oedema. Gravity causes
the fluid to build-up around the
ankles when they are in a position
lower than your knees for long
periods of time. This is more
common as you get older. Also if
you spend a lot of the day sitting
still. It usually affects both
legs/ankles, and is one of the commonest causes of ankle or lower leg swelling.
Possible causes of leg or ankle swelling in people with Parkinson’s include:

- Possible side effect of some Parkinson’s medications, such as dopamine
  agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine).
- Not moving as much can cause fluid to collect in the feet, ankles, and lower
  legs as the muscles are not pushing it back.
  Other non-Parkinson’s causes of leg or ankle swelling can be from:
- Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) if the swelling is confined to one leg, which
  may also be painful. This is more common in those having treatment for cancer,
  recent surgery or leg fracture (within 12 weeks), have been in bed for more
  than 3 days, or have had clots before.
- Infections in the legs – these are typically only on one side and usually cause a
  red, hot and painful leg.
- Injuries, such as a twisted ankle (you would normally be aware of the injury).
  It is usually only on one side and is often painful.
- Problems with major organs, such as your heart, liver, or kidney – these are
  usually either already known about or associated with other symptoms.
- Side effects of non-Parkinson’s medications (e.g. some blood pressure tablets).
  What should I do about it?
- You should be seen in A&E for assessment if you are also experiencing:
- Difficulty breathing; or changes in your breathing (wheezing, coughing, needing to
  sleep propped up on pillows)
- Chest pain - this might indicate a more serious cause that needs treatment.
- If you have a little bit of ankle swelling in both legs that isn’t too bothersome and
  none of the symptoms listed above, you could try the advice below (see section
  ‘What can I try for myself?’).
  If it doesn’t improve within a few weeks, make a routine GP appointment.
- If the swelling is more severe and bothersome, you should book an appointment
  with your GP and try the advice below in the meantime.
- If you have redness, warmth, wounds or ulcers overlying the swelling, that you are
  not receiving professional support for, you should see your GP as soon as possible.
  See our Skin Changes page for more information.
- If the swelling is new and in one leg only or developed very quickly (over hours
  or days) you should contact your GP or 111 for an urgent review.
  What can I try for myself?
  Change your feet position
- Leg and ankle swelling can get better at night due to lying flat overnight. This
  position makes it easier for the fluid to be reabsorbed into your body.
- When you are resting, sit with your legs straight out in front of you and your feet
  up on a pillow or a raised surface so that your ankles are higher than your knees,
  and your knees are higher than your hips to help the fluid drain.
- You could also try lying flat with your legs slightly raised on a pillow three to four
  times a day to help get rid of the extra fluid around your legs and ankles.
  Increase activity
- Movement and exercise is good for everyone, and especially
  good for people with Parkinson’s.
- If you are able to increase your activity levels, that will help the
  extra fluid move around your body and be reabsorbed.
- If you are most comfortable doing exercises while seated, you
  could raise your legs on a footstool and exercise your ankles
  regularly throughout the day. For example: flex your ankles up
  and down and all around in the shape of each letter of the
  alphabet throughout the day. This moves the fluid around and
  allows it to be reabsorbed.
  Select shoes carefully
  •
  •
- Wear shoes that can be loosened during the course of the day as swelling may get
  worse as the day goes on.
- Make sure your shoes can still hold firmly onto your feet as the swelling goes up
  and down. If they get too loose they might become a tripping or falling hazard, and
  if they are too tight you won’t be able to fasten them.
- Shop for shoes when your swelling is at its worst so you know the shoes will always
  fit.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I take one day at a time and I try to get him out every day if I can, even if
it’s around the block to keep his legs moving.” (Carer of someone with
Parkinson’s)
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professional will likely ask you more questions, so you could think
  about these in advance. You could record it in your My Health section to bring
  to the appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about:
- Your medication;
- The location of the swelling: one leg or both legs, above or below the knee
- Whether it came on quickly over hours or days, or more slowly over weeks and months
- Is part or all of the swelling red/inflamed, hot or tender?
- If it is affecting one side more than the other: Whether you have recently been immobile
  for more than 3 days, had recent surgery, fracture or treatment for cancer (within 12
  weeks) or been on a long haul flight or drive (more than 5 hours)?
- Whether you have had swelling before, and what helped it go away if so.
- Whether you have had any blood clots in the past or in your family.
- About your breathing: any difficulty breathing or shortness of breath; sleeping propped
  on pillows because of breathlessness lying flat?
- Have you experienced any chest pain?
- Any changes in urine, skin or eye colour?
- Any changes in the amount of urine you are passing?
- Have you noticed that you are bruising more easily than before?
- Have you noticed any change in your weight?
- Do you have any wounds in the areas with the swelling?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in your
  manual
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional
  identify patterns
- For ankle swelling you could record when the problem first
  started. If it fluctuates, you could record when it is most and
  least problematic to see if there is a pattern. You could keep
  track of how often you are exercising your ankles and legs
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, they may run further tests such as blood tests, urine
  tests, x-rays or scans.
  Further Treatments
  You may be given reassurance or more specific advice about things you could try
  yourself. You may be given help from a district or practice nurse. Advice might
  include, for example, support stockings you could wear to help reduce the
  swelling. You should discuss the use of support stockings with a healthcare
  professional first.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your medication if within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with
  a healthcare professional.
- See extra information below about some medications used for ankle
  swelling.
  •
  •
  o
  Diuretics (water pills) such as furosemide if the swelling is due to heart, liver or kidney
  conditions. Furosemide has limited effectiveness for swelling due to dopamine agonists.
- If a particular cause of the ankle swelling is found then there may be a treatment specific to
  that cause.
  See extra information below about medications that may affect this symptom.
  o
  Dopamine agonists can cause leg and ankle swelling as a side effect, e.g. pramipexole,
  ropinirole, rotigotine.
- Some medication used for blood pressure or heart conditions, called calcium channel
  blockers, e.g. amlodipine
- Some medication used for diabetes, e.g. pioglitazone
- Anti-inflammatory medication, e.g. ibuprofen, naproxen o Steroid
  medication, e.g. prednisolone
- These medications may need to be reduced or discontinued if swelling
  is problematic
  Referral
- Specialist referral may be required for certain causes of ankle swelling, or may be
  made for compression hosiery in some cases.
  Key Messages
- Swelling can be due to: decreased movement and exercise; a side effect of
  medication used in Parkinson’s; or unrelated to Parkinson’s.
- Increasing exercise and movement and changing your leg/feet position during
  the day can help to reduce swelling

Sleep Disturbances
Poor sleep leads to feeling less well in the daytime and can worsen other
difficulties, like low mood, concentration and balance. It may also affect those
close to you.
Parkinson’s can affect sleep in several different ways. Here we cover:

- Difficulty getting to or staying asleep
- Difficulty moving in bed
- A possible association with breathing changes during sleep
  Other issues that may affect your sleep include: •
  Urinary Symptoms
- Dream disturbances including uncontrolled
  movements whilst asleep
- Restless Legs
- Pain
- Spasms & Cramps
- Anxiety
- Low Mood
  These are covered on their own symptom page. Difficulties in getting in or out of
  bed is covered on the Daily Living page.
  What might be causing it?
  If someone with Parkinson’s experiences sleep disturbance, it is most likely due to
  Parkinson’s itself.
  It is at least partly thought to be caused by altered levels of the chemical
  messenger dopamine.
  Dopamine plays a role in sleep patterns as well as impacting movements.
  There are other factors than can worsen sleep problems, such as medications or
  lifestyle factors.
  Depression also causes sleep disturbance.
  Obstructive sleep apnoea is a breathing condition that is thought to be slightly
  more common in people with Parkinson’s than those without. It is a change in the
  pattern of breathing. It causes a pause, followed by catch-up breaths. This could
  be a gasp, loud snore, a few quick breaths or a choking noise. Although they might
  not realise it, the person is briefly woken by this, and so their sleep is disrupted
  and they tend to get very sleepy in the daytime.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself (see below). If however you are
  having violent movements during sleep you should discuss this with your
  Parkinson’s specialist team. For other sleep disturbances, try the strategies below.
  If you still have problems after 1 month then speak to your GP or Parkinson’s
  specialist team.
  If you or your partner notice the breathing pattern change as described above
  (pauses in breathing or loud snoring) then discuss with your GP.
  What can I try for myself?
  Things to try:
- Maintain regular sleep hours: try to get up at the same
  time each day, even if the sleep has not been good.
  You may need to set an alarm clock, even on
  weekends, to achieve this.
- A regular bedtime routine, ideally with some relaxation
  built in, such as a warm bath. For other relaxation
  techniques see Dealing with Stress and Challenges
  page.
- Increasing daytime activity, though avoid exercise just before bed (e.g. avoid
  vigorous exercise in the 2 hours before bed). See Keeping Active for ideas on how to
  do this.
- Empty your bladder before going to bed.
- If possible protect your bedroom environment: avoid using it for watching TV or
  working, and keep it warm (but not too hot), dark, comfortable and quiet. The
  optimal temperature for most people is around 16-18oC. Different curtains or blinds
  can change the light in the room, or some people use eye masks. Noise can be
  reduced by closing windows and doors, or by using earplugs.
- Nylon or satin sheets as well as light-weight bed covers, can be more comfortable
  and can make moving in bed easier. It is best not to have both satin Pyjamas and
  sheets as they can slide on each other very quickly. Ideally maintain some area of
  friction at the edge of the bed for grip.
  •
  •
- If you can, involve a partner, particularly if you need help getting in and out of bed.
  Try to avoid:
- Caffeine
  This is in tea, coffee, chocolate, cocoa, coca cola, some over-the-counter
  painkillers and ‘cold and flu’ remedies so check the label carefully. Reducing
  caffeine in the 4 hours before bed, as well as reducing the total daily intake,
  is advised.
- Alcohol
  This may initially make you sleepy but may then cause you to wake up and feel
  restless. It also makes you need to go to the toilet, which can disturb sleep.
- Smoking
  Nicotine, which is found in cigarettes, is a stimulant so, although people find it
  relaxing, it makes you feel more awake.
- Lying awake in bed
  Try to avoid spending lots of time in bed, particularly if not asleep. If you are
  not feeling sleepy then perhaps you could get up and go to a different room to
  try to relax a bit. Return to bed once you feel sleepy. You may want to keep a
  dressing gown or jumper nearby so you are comfortable when leaving the bed.
- Naps
  If you nap in the daytime you are less likely to sleep at night. Some people do
  feel they need naps, so it is best to limit the time spent napping to about 20
  minutes. You may need to set an alarm to achieve this.
- Screens
  Try to avoid TV, computer, tablet and mobile phone use in the period before
  going to bed. The light from the screen is stimulating so can make it more
  difficult to sleep.
- Large meals before bed
  Lying down after eating a large meal makes it more challenging for your body
  to digest the food properly. This is likely to make you feel uncomfortable and
  can make it more difficult for you to fall asleep and sleep undisturbed. Try to
  leave at least 2-3 hours after your last big meal of the day before going to bed.
- Unsuitable sleeping environment
  If possible, avoid using your bedroom for work or TV, or using your living space
  or chairs for sleep. Ideally, train your body to sleep in the bedroom and that
  brain-stimulating tasks are associated with another place. It takes time to re-
  train if one of these has become a habit.
  Note there is no specific bed or mattress recommended in Parkinson’s but more
  advice on furniture and equipment is covered in Daily Living.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I find a back or leg massage relaxes me and helps me drift off to sleep.”( Person with

Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about
  these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the
  appointment.
- See extra information below about things they might ask about.
- Lifestyle factors as described above
- What seems to be disturbing your sleep?
- Do you have other symptoms associated with the particular sleep disturbances: difficulty with
  movements in bed, urinary symptoms, restless legs, altered dreams or acting out dreams, pain
  or cramps?
- Is anyone else in the room when you sleep? Have they noticed snoring or pauses in your
  breathing?
- Have you noticed if the symptoms are affected by any of your medication?
- How is it impacting you? (e.g. mood, work, driving, relationships)
- Some clinicians use scoring systems so may go through a specific list of symptoms, such as the
  Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in your
  manual
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For sleep disturbance, it is useful to record when it occurs and exactly what happens.
  It can be helpful to record when you take your medication as well to see if it is related
  to sleep disturbance.
  •
  •
  It may be that your bed partner will be able to give you more details.
  Tests
  Tests are rarely needed but occasionally ‘sleep studies’ are run. This may involve
  applying a sleep monitor at home, or a short hospital stay to have sleep monitored.
  Further Treatments
  Having consulted a healthcare professional, they may offer reassurance, advice or
  further treatment. They may identify an underlying cause or factor that can be
  treated, such as depression or urinary symptoms.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your medication if within their expertise.
  Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a
  healthcare professional.
- Levodopa and dopamine agonists help sleep in some cases and make it worse in
  other cases. This can be a very tricky balance and is best discussed with your
  Parkinson’s specialist team.
  See extra information below for some medication used for sleep symptoms.
- Optimising Parkinson’s medications, to improve dopamine activity overnight, may improve
  sleep symptoms. This may be through using levodopa or a dopamine agonist. In some cases a
  more steady level is achieved through slow acting levodopa, or other routes of medication
  delivery (e.g. rotigotine patch, apomorphine infusion or intraduodenal levodopa).
- Sometimes a medication called melatonin is used. o There is weak evidence for zolpidem,
  quetiapine and clozapine.
- Melatonin and clonazepam are potential medication for REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder which
  is covered on the Dream Disturbances page.
  See extra information below for some medication that may make sleep symptoms
  worse. Sometimes the timing of these medicines can be adjusted to help sleep.
- Amantadine o Selegiline o Levodopa (particularly higher dose)
- Some long acting dopamine agonists, and some of the older (rarely
  used now) dopamine agonists (Pergolide, Cabergoline)
- Opiates o Medications used for depression, e.g. SSRIs o
  Ephedrine
  Referral
  You may be referred on to another service. Please be aware there is usually a
  waiting time before that next service will see you. Referrals may be made for
  specific contributory symptoms – see extra information below.
- Urology for urinary symptoms
- Psychology or psychiatry for mood symptoms
- Sleep or Respiratory clinics for suspected obstructive sleep apnoea
- Sleep clinics for dream disturbances.
  Referrals may also be made to help with strategies or equipment for moving in or
  around bed. These will usually be for Physiotherapy and/or Occupational Therapy.
  Key Messages
- Parkinson’s can affect sleep in many different ways, with various ways of tackling
  the different problems.
- Routine and lifestyle factors can have a significant impact on your sleep.

  Dream Disturbance
  Many people with Parkinson’s experience vivid dreams. For some this is no
  problem, but for others it can cause distress or disrupt sleep. This can impact how
  you feel in the daytime. Movement changes during dreams are also a symptom of
  Parkinson’s.
  Dreams occur during a phase of sleep
  known as Rapid Eye Movement (REM)
  sleep. This is named this way because the
  eyes move very fast during this phase. A key
  feature of this phase is that the body does
  not move. Some people with sleep
  problems lose this unconscious control over
  movement during sleep, and so they “act
  out” their dreams. This is called REM Sleep
  Behaviour Disorder
  (RBD). This ranges from gesturing, jerking and talking to thrashing around, shouting
  and walking. This is closely related to Parkinson’s. However not all people with
  Parkinson’s have RBD and not all people with RBD have Parkinson’s.
  Sometimes the difference between vivid dreams and being awake can become a
  bit unclear. See our
  Hallucinations page for more information on seeing things that aren’t there when
  awake.
  What might be causing it?
  Vivid dreams experienced by a person with Parkinson’s are most likely caused by
  the Parkinson’s itself.
  Factors that can make vivid dreams worse include:

* Some medications
* Stress, trauma and anxiety
* Changes to your sleep schedule (for example from jetlag)
* Insomnia (difficulty getting to or staying asleep)
* Alcohol and illicit drug use, or withdrawal from them
  Vivid dreams are also more common in:
* People with some mental health problems (such as depression and
  schizophrenia).
* Those with other sleep disorders (such as narcolepsy)
  •
  •
* Those with other physical illnesses (such as heart disease)
* Early pregnancy
  As with vivid dreams, RBD in someone with Parkinson’s is most likely caused by
  the condition itself. In people who do not have a diagnosis of Parkinson’s itis more
  common in men than women, and is also occurs more frequently in people with
  sleep disorders (e.g. narcolepsy), those taking certain medication, and those
  withdrawing from medication or alcohol after developing a dependency.
  What should I do about it?
  Vivid dreams don’t require any treatment if they are not causing distress. However
  if they are causing distress then some lifestyle changes can help. Also dealing with
  any factors that make it happen or make it worse (such as anxiety) can help.
  RBD exists across a range of severity and so the most important thing to consider
  is safety. Is there risk of injury to yourself or others from movements made during
  sleep? Features that would be a cause for concern are violent movements, falling
  from bed, or walking beyond the bed-space. These features would make it an
  urgent issue to address. If this is the case your Parkinson’s specialist team would
  be the preferred people to contact. If the movements are not as marked as this
  then it is not urgent but you should still discuss it with your Parkinson’s specialist
  team or GP.
  What can I try for myself?
  Lifestyle changes thought to improve sleep and reduce dream disturbances:
* Eating well and keeping well hydrated
* Optimising physical and mental health (see the Optimising wellbeing pages for
  advice)
* Keep a regular sleep schedule (see the Sleep Disturbances page for more detail)
* Tackle stress and anxiety (see Dealing with stress and challenges and Anxiety pages)
  If you are acting out dreams, consider the safety of yourself and your bed partner:
* Remove sharp or breakable objects or furniture from near the bedside.
* Consider putting cushions or pillows beside the bed.
* Would a lower bed or mattress on the floor be safer?
* Would a separate bed or room be preferable for your bed partner?
  Further assessment
  Questions
* Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about
  these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the
  appointment.
* See extra information about things they might ask about.
* What is the disturbance you experience
* Your sleep pattern
* Lifestyle factors
* Mood symptoms and other disturbances such as whether you experience hallucinations
* Risks, e.g. falling out of bed, and impact of the symptoms
* Your medication
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
* This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify
  patterns.
* For dream disturbances you could monitor your sleep pattern, when the
  dream problems occur and your medication. The length of time monitoring will
  depend on how often the dream problems are occurring. It is best to capture
  at least three occasions to look for patterns.
  Tests
  Tests are rarely needed but sometimes ‘sleep studies’ are run. This may involve a
  short hospital stay to have sleep monitored.
  Further treatments
  Having consulted a healthcare professional, they may offer reassurance, advice or
  further treatment.
  Medication
  •
  •
* Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s
  Specialist Nurse) may change your medication if it’s within their expertise.
* Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without
  speaking with a healthcare professional.
* See extra information below for some medication used for dream
  disturbances.
* Clonazepam
* Melatonin
* See extra information below for some medications that may affect your
  dreams.
* Medications for depression and anxiety, including mirtazapine and SSRIs
  (e.g. citalopram, sertraline) can worsen RBD. Speak to your healthcare
  professional before changing your medication.
  Key messages
* Some people with Parkinson’s experience more vivid dreams, calling out or
  acting out dreams.
* It is important to address any safety concerns. You should talk to your
  Parkinson’s specialist team if you experience these symptoms.

  Tiredness and Fatigue
  Tiredness affects everyone now and then. It tends to have an obvious cause, such
  as poor sleep.
  Tiredness often goes away with rest.
  Fatigue is more than simple tiredness. It can affect people in different ways.
  Sometimes it can be mild. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming. You may have a
  lack of energy and exhaustion. It can go on for a long time and impact day-to-day
  activity.
  Fatigue affects up to half of people with Parkinson’s. The exact cause of this is
  unknown but lots of factors can contribute.
  Daytime sleepiness is falling asleep or feeling like you might fall asleep during the
  day.
  What m ight b e c ausing i t?
  There a re l ots o f p ossible causes.
  Parkinson’s itself can cause fatigue and
  sleepiness, and fatigue may be an early
  symptom. In addition, drugs used in
  Parkinson’s can cause sleepiness. Tiredness
  can also occur when the medication wears
  off. This is noticed before the next dose is
  due.
  Another common cause of fatigue or tiredness are stress or
  feeling low, which can impact on sleep. See our pages on Low Mood and Anxiety.
  Sleep problems due to other causes can also impact on daytime tiredness. See the
  page on Sleep disturbances.
  Less common causes of fatigue include some medical problems such as anaemia,
  diabetes or thyroid problems.
  If you suddenly feel very tired or lacking in energy this may indicate that you are
  unwell from something else such as an infection. However, in this case you would
  probably have other symptoms too, e.g. fever.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself as below. But there are instances
  where you should seek professional help.
  See your GP if:
* You feel constantly tired for more than 4 weeks
* You are tired and feeling unwell
* You are very bothered by your tiredness
* You have also lost your appetite or lost some weight
  You should see your GP or contact your Parkinson’s specialist team if:
* You have started falling asleep during tasks.
* Your symptoms have come on since starting a new Parkinson’s medication.
  If you are falling asleep during tasks, it is important to consider your safety. You must not
  drive and should consider other scenarios (e.g. baths) where falling asleep unexpectedly
  could be dangerous.
  What can I try for myself?
  There are some simple strategies that may help. You may have tried some of these already.
  In day-to-day life
* It may be helpful to think about what aspects of your life are tiring. Are there any
  triggers you can avoid?
* You might need to pace yourself more. To help with this think what it is most
  important for you to achieve that day. Try to focus on this.
* Bigger tasks can be broken down to something you think you can finish that day.
* Be realistic, most things can wait for another day.
  Further strategies are seen below, not all will be applicable to you.
  •
  •
  If you are tired at work
* Try to take regular breaks when you work.
* Discuss how this can be achieved with your employer, who must make suitable
  adjustments: see
  Work & Caring page for more advice.
  If you are tired at home
* Try and pace yourself throughout the day. Take breaks when you feel tired.
* Schedule important tasks for when you feel less tired.
* Do what you can yourself but recognise when you have difficulty.
  Napping
* A short nap (e.g. 20-30minutes) can help during the day, especially after a meal, and
  reduce fatigue.
* However, it is important to get the balance right as frequent napping can make
  sleeping at night more difficult.
* If you get fatigued after meals, you can try lighter meals at lunchtime.
  The role of exercise
* Fatigue can cause people to be less active and the
  less active you become, the more tired you feel.
* We know keeping active is good for people with
  Parkinson’s. It can help fatigue, mood, sleep and
  general health.
* Do as much as you can handle; it can be as simple
  as chair based exercises. See Staying Active for
  ideas.
* If there is a pattern to your tiredness, plan to
  exercise regularly at times you have a bit more energy.
  Healthy body and mind
* Keeping the mind active can help, for example keeping up hobbies or things you enjoy.
* As well as a healthy balanced diet, a small snack every few hours may help your energy
  levels.
* There is no evidence that multi-vitamins or ‘tonics’ help if you have a good healthy
  diet.
* Drinking too much alcohol can affect quality of sleep and make you tired.
* See Sleep Difficulties page for more advice on getting good sleep.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“With Parkinson’s, I use my energy wisely. I think to myself, what’s more
important for me to do today. And I’ll put my energies there.” (Person with
Parkinson’s)
“It varies how I feel. If I don’t feel too good, I’m on the couch resting to get
my energy levels up. I don’t push the body to do things that I know that I
can’t. If I’m tired, I just stop. And I just wait until I feel better, then perhaps
if I’ve not been out all day, I’ll go for a little brisk walk or something and get
some fresh air and do that instead. Yes, the body kind of like tells you what
to do rather than you tell it.” Person with Parkinson’s
“I love entertaining. I love cooking for people and having people in the
home. But I’ve got to pace myself. I mean that’s just partly my age as well
as having Parkinson’s. But I know that if we had a lot of people in and, if
I’m having people around for dinner, I’ve got to make sure I’ve got a quiet
day either side and I’ve got to plan ahead. So I’ll lay the table a couple of
days before and I’ll try and shop and do a lot of the preparation before I
actually have people round” (Person with Parkinson’s)

Thinking and Remembering
Difficulties with thinking and
remembering are common in
Parkinson’s. They can be very
worrying for the person
experiencing these as well as for
those around them. As we get older,
we are likely to notice more
difficulties with our memory, speed
of thinking, and ability to do several
things at once. But bigger changes, particularly if they affect day-to-day activities,
are not normal and should be discussed with
a healthcare professional. Vocabulary and reading do not normally get worse with
age. Difficulties with thinking and memory are not always signs of dementia.
For information about more advanced symptoms, including dementia, see the
Progression of Symptoms page.
What might be causing it?
Memory and thinking problems can be symptoms of Parkinson’s, but not all of
them are. The difficulties in Parkinson’s tend to come on slowly. See extra
information below.
•
•
Parkinson’s tends to affect the following components of thinking:

- Executive function. This is the control of thinking, and includes planning, keeping things in
  mind, flexible thinking, and self-control. For example, when cooking a meal, someone with
  executive function problems may find it difficult to get all the right ingredients and plan
  what time to start cooking them so they will be ready at the same time.
- Attention (staying focused on something). This might be conscious or an automatic process
  such as listening in a conversation. Problems might, for example, show as difficulties
  reading, following a conversation, or multi-tasking.
- Language (remembering and understanding words and meanings). Problems might, for
  example, show as forgetting the word for something or not managing to understand more
  complex conversations.
- Visuospatial function. This includes being able to judge distances and depth, imagine things
  visually and process them in your mind and detecting patterns. Problems might, for
  example, show as getting off at the wrong bus stop, misjudging the depth of a step or not
  being able to imagine the kitchen to describe where the tea is kept.
- Memory (being able to recall things). Problems might, for example, show as someone
  repeating themselves or not remembering the plot of a TV programme they recently
  watched.
  Dementia is a broad term used to describe gradual impairments of thinking,
  memory and other brain functions that are impacting day-to-day life. Dementia
  has lots of different types and causes, one of which is Parkinson’s. But not all
  thinking and memory problems in Parkinson’s are, or lead to, dementia.
  Other causes of memory and thinking problems that appear gradually include:
- Depression and anxiety
- Sleep disturbance
- Various medications
- Hormone imbalances (e.g. hypothyroidism)
- Vitamin deficiencies (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency)
- Alcohol abuse
- Abnormal blood chemistry (e.g. high calcium or low sodium levels). These are
  important to identify as they have specific treatments.
  Memory and thinking problems, or confusion, can also occur as sudden changes
  in alertness. This is known as delirium. The change in alertness may mean you feel
  hyperactive or drowsy, or you may fluctuate between these. There is no single test
  that can be done to diagnose delirium, so the diagnosis is made through
  assessment by a healthcare professional. Delirium is a response to a new stress
  put on the body. Tests may be done to identify the trigger which may then be
  treatable, though in many cases the cause is not found. Typical causes include:
- Infections and other medical problems
- Medications
- Abnormal blood chemistry (e.g. high or low blood sugar levels).
  What should I do about it?
  If there has been a sudden noticeable change in your thinking or memory (i.e. you
  become confused over hours or days) then you should see a healthcare
  professional urgently. If you are otherwise well this should be your GP, but if you
  are very ill then you should go to A&E.
  If the onset of your symptoms has been more gradual (weeks to months) then
  there is more time to act. If the symptoms persist more than 1 month or are
  impacting your daily life then you should make a non-urgent appointment with
  your GP. You should also discuss them with your Parkinson’s specialist team. But
  there are many things you can try for yourself to deal with the symptoms as well.
  What can I try for myself?
  There are many things you can try to help you manage difficulties with memory
  and thinking.
  Take your time
  Stress worsens thinking abilities so don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Tasks
  may take longer, so give yourself more time for them.
  Keep well
  Good sleep, physical health and emotional well-being are all important for your
  memory and thinking.
  See our Optimising Wellbeing pages for more information.
  Prompts and reminders
  •
  •
- Lists – e.g. a “To-do-list” or a list of things to take with you when
  you go out. You can record lists and memos here: Notes and Lists.
- Calendars/organisers – e.g. to help remember your
  appointments or friends’ birthdays. You can enter your
  appointments and set reminders here: Appointments & Hospital
  Stays .
- Clocks and alarms – Having a prominent and easy-to-read clock may help your
  timekeeping. Many devices allow you to set alerts (e.g. setting an alarm clock
  or a phone alarm to remind you to take your medication or setting the oven
  timer to remind you when dinner is ready).
- Keep track – if you are struggling to remember things that have happened,
  you could record them for future reference. If you are struggling to remember
  what has been happening with your Parkinson’s when speaking with
  healthcare professionals, you could try recording things using the Symptom &
  Activity Tracker.
  Establish Routines
  Keeping to a routine can help you to remember things and requires less conscious
  effort to carry out the activities. In other words, it becomes a habit.
  Social Support
  Use people around you. For example, friends or family might be able to help you
  remember things or accompany you to appointments. Maintaining social and
  leisure activities has been shown to help with memory and thinking functions.
  You could also consider using befriending services. These are
  volunteers who chat with you over the phone or visit you at
  home on a regular basis. See Parkinson’s UK and Age UK for more
  information on how to access local befriending services.
  Medication
  You may find managing your Parkinson’s medication more
  challenging if you have problems with thinking or remembering. There are several
  devices available to help you; see the Medications page for more information.
  Slowing down the problem
  There is no recommended treatment to stop or prevent memory and thinking
  problems. Things that may have some positive effects without harmful consequences
  include:
- Physical exercise – see our Keeping Active page for ideas.
- “Brain Training” or “Cognitive Training” – memory and attention puzzles and
  calculations (e.g.
  Sudoku).
  It’s important to note there is not currently enough evidence to recommend these.
  Further Assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about
  these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to
  the appointment.
- See extra information below about what they might ask about with regard to
  memory and thinking.
- Have you developed any new physical symptoms? o How has your mood been? o How
  has your sleep been? o Have you lost weight? o Have there been any recent changes to
  your medications?
- How do the thinking and memory problems affect your day-to-day life? For example,
  working, taking medications, getting washed and dressed, paying your bills.
- Have there been any serious consequences of the thinking and memory problems? For
  example, getting lost, getting into debt, driving accidents or near-misses, or leaving the
  gas on.
  They may ask questions to assess different aspects of memory and thinking. Try not
  to worry about this too much as getting stressed can make it harder.
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in
  your manual
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- If you think the problem is variable, try recording when it is at its best and when it
  is at its worst. Note what you have done on those days that is different compared
  to a typical day.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist may arrange
  some further tests.
  •
  •
  This may include blood tests, urine tests or occasionally a brain scan.
  Further Treatments
  A healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance or possibly further
  treatment.
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your medication.
  Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking
  with a healthcare professional.
  See extra information below about some medication used for memory and
- If a significant memory and thinking problem is identified, the first line treatment is a
  type of medication called a cholinesterase inhibitor. There are several different types,
  but most commonly used are rivastigmine or donepezil.
- If these are not suitable due to other medical problems, or if the side effects are a big
  problem, then the next choice is a medication called memantine.
  thinking difficulties.
  See extra information below about some medications that may make memory
  and thinking worse for some people. There are benefits and risks of all medication
  so you should speak to your healthcare professional if you have any concerns.
- Anticholinergic medications (e.g. oxybutynin, solifenacin, amitriptyline)
- Parkinson’s medications (e.g. selegiline or amantadine)
- Sedating medications (e.g. benzodiazepines like diazepam and clonazepam).
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service. Please be aware that there is usually
  a waiting time before the next service will see you.
- The typical referral for memory and thinking problems is to a multi-professional
  service called a “memory clinic”. Or, you may be referred for a specialist
  assessment by a cognitive neuropsychologist.

  Impulsive Behaviours
  ‘Impulsive’ and ‘compulsive’ behaviours occur when someone has difficulty
  controlling urges or desires. This means they behave in a way that is out of
  character or undertake activities that they would not normally do. The individual
  may not be aware of the problem.
  People with impulsive and compulsive behaviours are driven to things that give
  instant reward. Examples of these behaviours or activities include sexual
  behaviours, gambling, binge eating and obsessive shopping. Other people may
  simply spend excessive amounts of time pursuing a hobby or with DIY in a way that
  interferes with other activities. People may also feel the need to take objects apart,
  or to continuously hold or handle objects in their hands. Note, the ‘reward’ might
  not be what you expect. For example, the act of gambling might give the ‘reward’
  rather than winning, or the act of shopping rather than the product bought.
  Why does this happen? The behaviour or
  activity bring feelings of pleasure. Stopping the
  behaviour or activity brings feelings of tension
  and restarting the behaviour or activity
  relieves that tension. It is normal for behaviour
  to be driven by ‘rewards’ but disruption to the
  normal control can lead to impulsive
  behaviours, like an addiction. Sometimes
  people may continue to do the behaviour or
  activity even after the feeling of pleasure or reward they originally felt has gone.
  People may also experience a compulsion to take more than their prescribed
  amount of Parkinson’s medications. They may be addicted to the way it makes
  them feel. This is called ‘dopamine dysregulation syndrome’. If their healthcare
  provider tries to reduce it to the amount they are supposed to take, this may cause
  upset feelings, cravings for the medication, or reduced mobility. Sometimes people
  will not accept a reduction in medication: they may become aggressive or secretly
  hoard medications.
  Others may not realise they are increasingly taking more medication than the
  amount their healthcare provider has prescribed. It’s important that family
  members or carers know your prescribed doses so they can spot if you are taking
  too much.
  What might be causing it?
  The chemical dopamine in the brain is affected in Parkinson’s. Dopamine has many
  roles, including being involved in the brain control of reward and motivation.
  Medications that affect dopamine messaging in the brain also affect this control.
  People with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to develop these impulsive and
  compulsive behaviours if they are prescribed dopamine agonists (including
  ropinirole, rotigotine, pramipexole, and bromocriptine). These impulsive
  behaviours can also occur when taking levodopa. These behaviours may develop
  at any time during Parkinson’s disease, even if people have been on these
  medications for a long time.
  People may also be more likely to develop these behaviours if they are younger at
  the age of diagnosis, or have a history of alcoholism or addictive behaviours in
  their families. It appears to affect men more than women.
  What should I do about it?
- It is important that people with Parkinson’s, loved ones and carers are aware of the
  possibility of these behaviours.
  You should report any unusual or impulsive behaviours to a specialist as soon as they
  are noticed.
- That’s because the best way to treat these behaviours is with careful medication
  adjustments or changes.
  What c an I t ry f or m yself?
  Speak to your specialist
- The most effective management is
  speaking to your specialist, who can make
  changes to your medications or adjust
  your dosages
  •
  •
- It is best to talk to your specialist or GP as soon as anyone spots a
  concerning change
  Monitor for potential problems
- People with impulsive or compulsive behaviours may not recognize the
  problem. It is therefore a good idea to let others whom you trust know that
  this can occur so they can watch out for signs of this problem.
- Signs may be: weight gain from suspected binge eating, increased spending
  habits or borrowing money, increased sexual behaviours or other unusual
  behaviours.
- Some people find it helpful to share their bank statements with a trusted friend
  or relative to watch out for unusual spending.
  Reducing risk
  For people who have had problems with impulsive behaviours, some strategies might be
  helpful alongside the medication changes:
- Some people find it helpful to block certain websites (e.g. pornography,
  internet shopping, gambling sites)
- Some people find it helpful to give credit/debit cards to a trusted friend or
  relative for safekeeping or to restrict the amount they can spend
- Ensuring that you only have access to the medications you need to take on a
  given day can prevent you from taking too much medication
  Look after your mental wellbeing
- Stress, anxiety and depression can make impulsive and compulsive behaviour
  changes worse.
- See the Optimising Wellbeing pages for tips on keeping well.
  Further Treatments
- It’s important to treat any depression, because low mood can make any
  compulsive or impulsive behaviours worse. Treating the depression may make
  the behaviours better.
- Psychological or talking treatments may also be helpful for some people to help
  with the impulsive behaviours or associated problems
  Medication:
- Your specialist can adjust or change your Parkinson’s or other medications
  carefully in order to decrease the compulsive behaviours
- They may also refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further support or
  treatment.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking
  with a healthcare professional.
  Key Messages
- Impulsive and compulsive behaviours can cause someone to act in a way
  that is out of character for them.
- Affected individuals may not have insight to see that the activities are
  causing a problem in their life.
- While these may be difficult topics to raise with your specialist, they are
  side effects of medication and your specialist will be aware of them. It’s best
  to share concerns early, before little problems become big.
- The best treatment for impulsive and compulsive behaviours are

Hallucinations & Related Symptoms
Hallucinations, visual illusions, and delusions may occur
in people with Parkinson’s. They are most often a side
effect of medication, but they can also be a symptom of
Parkinson’s, or part of another condition, such as
dementia. These issues are not common, but can be
upsetting for the person experiencing them, and for
their loved ones and carers.
Hallucinations are seeing, tasting, smelling, feeling, or hearing things that aren’t
there. For example, seeing children or small animals that are not there.
Visual illusions are mistaking real objects for things that they are not. This might
be, for example, seeing an umbrella on the floor and thinking it is a snake or seeing
a coat hanging on a door and thinking it is a person.
Delusions are strongly held thoughts or beliefs that are not based on reality. For
example, someone may have paranoid thoughts or beliefs about a carer or another
close contact. This can make them suspicious or mistrust the carer or close contact.
Delusions may also include jealous thoughts or beliefs of having special powers.
These could potentially lead to unusual or unsafe behaviour. People who are
experiencing severe delusions may be convinced they are true, and may find it
difficult to tell what is real or not in their daily lives.
What might be causing it?
Parkinson’s causes of hallucinations, illusions, and delusions:

- Can occur with certain Parkinson’s medications:
- Dopamine
  agonists o
  Levodopa
- Anticholinergic
  medicines (e.g.
  trihexyphenidyl) o
  Amantadine
- Are more common in people who have had Parkinson’s for many years
- Are more common in people experiencing “off” times with their medications
- Are more common in people experiencing lots of sleeping/waking problems
  Non-Parkinson’s causes of hallucinations, illusions, and delusions:
- Delirium: when someone becomes unwell due to other new stresses on the
  body, such as from infection or chemical imbalances in the blood. This is more
  common in older people and those with memory problems. It also causes a
  change in alertness: someone with delirium may be more drowsy, hyperactive
  or changing between these.
- Significant memory problems or dementia.
- Eyesight problems.
- Mental health conditions such as schizophrenia or severe depression. • Sleep
  problems.
  What should I do about it?
- If hallucinations are a sudden new problem, you should see your GP promptly
  (within a couple of days) as there may be something causing it that can be
  treated. This could be for example an infection.
- If hallucinations or these other symptoms are more of a gradual problem, it is
  important to consult your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP as soon as you’re
  able to as they can cause worry and stress for you and others around you. A
  change in the medications used for Parkinson’s may help to reduce these
  symptoms.
  What can I try for myself?
  •
  •
  It is important to discuss the hallucinations, illusions, and/or delusions with your
  Parkinson’s specialist team or GP. This is so that they can see if any potentially
  treatable causes could be adding to the problem or if a change in your Parkinson’s
  medication might help.
  Look a t s urroundings
- Visual illusions can often occur at certain times of
  day. This could be, for example, around the time
  evening is starting and lighting is getting low. It may
  help to turn the room lights on earlier in the evening
  than usual.
- If certain objects are frequently mistaken as visual
  illusions, consider removing these objects from the
  room or changing the lighting in the room to alter the
  shadows. (it may be worth examining the lighting and how things are arranged
  at home in case this could be
  contributing to the problem)
- Try talking to a close friend or relative if you suspect you are hallucinating or
  seeing a visual illusion. They may be able to help you to recognise a
  hallucination or visual illusion and to decrease your anxiety about them.
- If you can recognise a visual illusion or a hallucination for what it is and it is
  actually not disturbing to you, then perhaps no further action is needed.
  Further
  Assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals will likely ask more questions, so you could think
  about these in advance. You could record this information in your “My Health”
  section to bring to the appointment See extra information below about things
  they might ask about with regard to hallucinations.
- When did the problem start? o What have you been
  experiencing? o Did it come on suddenly or gradually?
- Have any other new symptoms started at around the same
  time?
- Have you felt drowsy or lethargic? Too active or alert? o When
  was the diagnosis of Parkinson’s made? o What medications are you
  taking? Have these changed recently? o Are there any concerns about
  memory? If yes, when did that begin? o Do you have any difficulties
  with eyesight or hearing? o Have you felt low in mood or depressed? o
  How is your sleep at night?
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in
  your manual
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify
  patterns
- You could monitor when the hallucinations or related symptoms are
  happening, and if anything seems to make them worse or better. If there is a
  change (e.g. they become more upsetting) then note this down.
  Tests
  Tests are often not needed, but depending on their assessment, healthcare
  professionals may run further tests such as blood tests or a brain scan.
  Further treatments
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s
  Specialist Nurse) may change your medication if it’s within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking
  with a healthcare professional.
  See extra information about some medication that may be contributing to the
  problem, which may be reduced or stopped.
  •
  •
- Parkinson’s medications, in particular anticholinergics (e.g. trihexyphenidyl), amantadine
  and dopamine agonists (e.g. ropinirole, pramipexole), but also MAO-B inhibitors (e.g.
  rasagiline), COMT inhibitors (e.g. entacapone) and Levodopa.
- Steroid medication, e.g. prednisolone
- Strong pain killers, e.g. codeine, tramadol, morphine
- Anti-cholinergic medication, e.g. solifenacin, oxybutynin
- Medication used for anxiety, depression or sleep
- Sometimes the combined effect of taking many different medication may be contributing
  so reducing the total number of medication may be recommended.
  Medication is only used in severe cases where the problem is causing distress. See extra
  information below about medication that is sometimes used if people have severe
  hallucinations or delusions.
- Quetiapine (this is first-line in NICE 2017 guideline if medication is needed).
- Clozapine (note this requires close monitoring in a specialist service)
- Rivastigmine
- Note some medicines that might be used in other contexts for hallucinations are no suitable
  in Parkinson’s: Olanzapine, Risperidone, Aripiprazole, ‘typical antipsychotics’ such as
  haloperidol.
  t
  Key messages
- Hallucinations, illusions, and delusions can occur in Parkinson’s. Hallucinations are
  most commonly a side effect of medication but can also be a symptom of
  Parkinson’s or other conditions, like dementia.
- It is important to discuss with your Parkinson’s specialist team if you are
  experiencing hallucinations, illusions, or delusions.

  Variability of Symptoms
  Variability of symptoms occurs when people with
  Parkinson’s change from having good, consistent
  control of their symptoms to having less
  consistent, less predictable control. This change
  in control may happen slowly over time or may
  be more of a sudden change.
  A medication dose may not last as long as it did
  it in the past. People refer to this as the
  medication ‘wearing off’. Some people notice
  their tablets don’t ‘kick in’ right away after taking
  them. Others notice their medications don’t
  work as smoothly as they did before.
  People may have times in between doses where
  they don’t feel as well. This variability of
  symptoms is referred to as ‘on’ and ‘off’ times:
- Being ‘on’: when you are moving,
  thinking, and feeling well
- Being ‘off’: when you are not moving, thinking, or feeling well These refer
  to movement or ‘motor’ symptoms (e.g. tremor, slowness, and stiffness) and
  ‘non-motor’ symptoms (e.g. anxiety, low mood, sweating, and restlessness).
  For some people, the variability is predictable and in relation to medication. For
  others, the variability does not follow a pattern and this can be very challenging to
  manage.
  What might be causing it?
  No one knows for sure why variability of symptoms - or motor fluctuations - occurs.
  Researchers think it’s related to the way levodopa stimulates the brain. They
  usually occur after a person has had Parkinson’s for a longer time. Fluctuations are
  also more common with higher doses of levodopa. Illness or infection unrelated to
  Parkinson’s can make you feel unwell and lead to changes in your symptoms. This
  is different to the ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods described above.
  What should I do about it?
  There are things you can try for yourself (described below). You should discuss with
  your Parkinson’s specialist team things you can try. Medicine adjustments may be
  possible.
  What can I try for myself?
  Make the most of ‘on’ time
- Make the most of time when you are feeling ‘on’ and schedule your activities
  for these times.
  Plan ahead
- Some people find that their off periods are worse after an exhausting day. Plan
  ahead so you can rest after you have had an exhausting day, if you experience
  that.
  Manage stress
- Stress can increase the variability of symptoms, so finding
  ways to stay relaxed even when stressed can be helpful.
- Complementary therapies such as massage, acupuncture,
  and aromatherapy may be helpful.
- See our Anxiety page for more information.
  Medication-Meal Timing
- If you notice medications aren’t working as quickly or smoothly as before,
  consider taking them a while before meal times (e.g. 30 minutes before).
- This is particularly applicable when having high protein meals. Protein is an
  essential part of diet and is important for tissue healing and overall health. It
  should be a part of everyone’s daily diet.
- Some people find that taking their levodopa 30 minutes before their protein meal
  allows their medication to kick in before they start eating.
- If taking levodopa on an empty stomach causes nausea, try taking it with fruit or
  crackers rather than high protein foods.
- See Eating Well for more information about diet.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“What I usually do is I’ll sit back and I’ll [..] take deep breaths and then I just sort of
think, ‘calm down, just calm down’, you know, and sort of bring myself back again.”
(Person with Parkinson’s)
“We talked to him about changing his medication around, which he did do, and he
took them a little bit earlier in the evening so he would feel a little bit more able.”
(health care professional)
Further Assessment
Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these
  in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the
  appointment.
  See extra information about the kind of things they might ask you about.
- The timing of the fluctuations in your symptoms (for example when you feel
  ‘off’ and how long for)
- How you feel at the different times (e.g. stiff movements, or low mood) o
  Your current medication in detail (including what you take, when, and how)
  and how you feel your body responds to the medication.
  Track your symptoms in
  the Symptom and
  Activity Tracker
  This can help you to recall the details
  and the professional to identify
  patterns. o This is particularly
  useful for variable symptoms. It can
  help you and your specialist
  understand how your medication affects you, how often you are having
  difficulties, and guides medication adjustment.
  Try to monitor your symptoms for about 3 days. See extra information below for
  types of things you could record.
- When you feel ‘on’ and ‘off’
- When you take your medication
- When you eat your meals
- Any other symptoms, such as dyskinesia or freezing.
  Further Treatments
  Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist
  Nurses) may change your medication.
  Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking
  with a healthcare professional
  See extra information below about what changes might be discussed with you.
- Longer-lasting medications for Parkinson’s (e.g. long-acting levodopa
  preparations, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors or COMT-inhibitors like
  entacapone).
- Dividing your current total dose of levodopa into smaller, more frequent
  doses.
- Adding additional “rescue” doses of antiparkinsonian medication, e.g.
  dispersible levodopa preparations which act quickly
  Referral
- You may be referred on to another service.
- There is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you.
- If the variation in symptoms is causing difficulty with daily activities, your GP or
  Parkinson’s specialist team may refer you on to an occupational therapist. They can
  assess if you might benefit from extra equipment or support.
- If your Parkinson’s specialist has tried all medication options and the variability is still
  having a significant impact on your daily life then other options may be explored. This
  usually involves a referral to a specialist centre. See extra information below for some
  alternative options.
  •
  •
- Apomorphine, a dopamine agonist delivered by injection either intermittently or as a
  continuous daytime infusion. See Medication page for more information.
- Deep brain stimulation or Duodopa (a gel given by a tube directly into the gut). See our
  Advanced & Surgical Treatments page for more advanced therapies.
  Key Messages
- Variability of symptoms involves going from having consistent, good control of
  your Parkinson’s symptoms to less consistent, less good control over symptoms.
  This includes both movement and non-movement symptoms.
- This includes ‘wearing off’ of medication, and changing between periods of better
  control (‘on’) and less good control (‘off’).
- There are things you can try yourself to help with variable symptoms. Your
  Parkinson's specialist team should also be able to suggest options which may help.

Weight & Appetite Loss
People with Parkinson’s can experience weight loss. Though some
people may initially welcome this, excessive weight loss can be bad for
both health and wellbeing. Weight loss can be linked to conditions that
are not Parkinson’s, and some can be serious. So it is important that you
see your GP if you continue to lose weight.
What might be causing it?
Causes of weight loss related to Parkinson’s include:

- Practical issues in making food.
- Swallowing problems.
- Increased movements.
- Symptoms that cause difficulties when you shop.
- Practical problems when you try to eat, e.g. coordination or being able to focus.
  There are many other conditions that might cause weight loss. This can include loss
  of appetite with depression, side effects of some medications and various health
  conditions. If you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to, your doctor may
  need to check you don’t have a serious health condition, such as a cancer. Some
  people as they get older have a reduced sense of taste and a lower appetite. As a
  result they might eat smaller portions and lose weight. However, weight loss is not
  a normal part of ageing, and should be checked out.
  What should I do about it?
  You should contact your GP if you:
- Have persistent, unintentional weight loss of more than 5% of your body
  weight (this depends on your weight, but is around 3kg or 7lb) over 6 – 12
  months or less
- Are struggling to put on weight despite the suggestions below
- Are worried about your weight loss
  If the above do not apply to you, or whilst waiting for your appointment, there are
  things you can try for yourself.
  What can I try for myself?
- Try to eat 3 meals a day with 2 or 3 high energy snacks throughout the day.
- Aim to eat every 3 hours during the day.
  •
  •
- Try adding extras to enrich your food. This could be cream, skimmed milk
  powder, butter, grated cheese, oil or honey. These will provide you with more
  energy.
- Higher energy snack ideas could include peanut butter or avocado on toast,
  rice pudding, yoghurt or a milk-shake.
- Milkshakes or malted drinks can supplement your diet. This could replace a cup
  of tea or coffee, or have them for a bedtime drink. Make sure these do not
  replace meals.
- Smoking, as well as being bad for your health, can also suppress your appetite.
  If you smoke, try not to smoke in the half-hour before your meal.
- Try not to fill up on drinks shortly before or during meals.
- Fresh air can often stimulate your appetite. If possible go for a brief stroll or go
  outside for a while before eating. Eating in a well-ventilated room can also help.
- If you’re too tired to cook, use ready-
  made oven/microwave foods or freeze
  extra portions of meals when cooking
  and use another day.
- There are a variety of ways that you can
  purchase meals such as: o Meals-on-
  Wheels
- Ready meal delivery services (such as
  Wiltshire Farm Foods or Oakhouse foods) o
  Lunch clubs o Day centres
  Consider what would be convenient for you.
  There are also tips that may be relevant on the Difficulty Swallowing and Nausea
  symptom pages if these are leading you to eat less. If maintaining weight is difficult
  because of practical aspects of buying, preparing or eating food then see the Daily
  Living page for guidance.
  Further assessment
  Questions
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think
  about these in advance. Record this in your “My Health” section to bring to the
  appointment.
  See extra information below about things they might ask about.
- Appetite
- Change in bowel habit
- Loose stools
- Stomach pain or heartburn
- Vomiting
- Problems swallowing
- Tiredness or energy levels
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Mood
- Rashes
- Lifestyle and diet
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in
  your manual
- Showing your healthcare workers a record of your daily intake of food and drink
  for 3 days can help them decide what to suggest next. If you see a dietician they
  may ask for a more detailed record.
- Monitor your weight monthly - it is helpful to have measurements to know how
  much weight is lost. You can record this in your “My Health” page.
  Tests
  If the cause for weight loss is not clear, they may run further tests such as blood
  tests or scans.
  •
  •
  Further Treatments
- Referral: Your GP may refer you to another service,
  depending on your issue:
- A dietician o A speech and language therapist,
  if swallowing is a problem
- Occupational therapist or physio, depending on
  your issue
- You may be referred to other medical specialists. This depends on the
  suspected cause of the weight loss.
  Key Messages
- There are many causes of weight loss, both related and not related to
  Parkinson’s.
- Weight loss is seen in Parkinson’s, but it is important that people do not lose a
  lot of weight. This can have a negative impact on wellbeing and health.
- You can have a lower appetite as you get older, but weight loss is not a normal
  part of ageing.
- Persistent unintentional weight loss needs investigation by your GP.

  Nausea
  Nausea can be described as feeling sick and can lead to vomiting.
  What might be causing it?
  Both Parkinson’s itself and the drugs used to treat it can cause nausea. Nausea that
  started after recently starting any new drug should go away on its own with time.
  Constipation can cause nausea and is common in Parkinson’s. It can occur years
  before movement problems start. Please see the page on Bowel Symptoms for
  more information.
  •
  •
  An illness called gastroparesis can cause nausea. This is common in Parkinson's. It
  occurs when the stomach empties into the gut very slowly. It can cause changes,
  e.g, nausea, vomiting and feeling full after eating a small amount of food. This can
  lead to weight loss and dehydration.
  Nausea may have a cause not related to your Parkinson’s. Common causes include
  anxiety or stress, stomach problems such as reflux, food poisoning or ulcers,
  migraine or infections (e.g. of the urinary tract or inner ear). These conditions will
  tend to cause other symptoms as well as nausea.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself (see below). But there are times
  when you should seek professional help. For example, if you have nausea with
  other changes (as seen below) or the nausea is concerning you.
  If you experience only nausea, you could try some of the things below. If it doesn’t
  improve in 1 month, seek help from your GP. But if you are concerned see your GP
  sooner.
  What can I try for myself?
  The following may help relieve nausea. If these do not help, there are medicines
  that can be used.
  Things to do

* Get fresh air
* Take sips of a cold drink
* Drink ginger or peppermint tea
* Eat food containing ginger
* Eat smaller, more frequent meals
* Follow our advice about Bowel Symptoms
  Things to avoid
* Do not eat strong-smelling food
* Do not eat spicy overly sweet, fried or greasy food
* Do not eat quickly
* Do not lie down soon after eating
* Do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist
  Nausea or vomiting after taking Parkinson’s medication
  Nausea can occur if you take
  medications on an empty
  stomach. Which is why for many
  medications the advice is to take
  them with meals. However, with
  Parkinson’s medications, some
  people find that it is less effective
  when taken with a main meal.
  If this is a problem for you, try
  taking your medication at least
  half an hour before your main meal. Also, with plenty of water and a small
  snack, such as a biscuit.
  Further Assessment
  Questions
  If you need to see a health-care worker about your nausea, they are likely to ask
  more questions. You can think about these in advance. You could record them in
  your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
  See extra information below about things they might ask about regarding nausea.
* How long it has been going on for
* If there is anything that makes it better or worse
* Symptoms related to your stomach, such as vomiting, weight loss, tummy pain, heartburn,
  change in bowel habit, problems swallowing.
* The presence of blood in vomit or stool.
* Symptoms related to the ears, such as deafness, dizziness, ringing in ears.
* Whether there is a link to drugs, diet or bowel motions.
* Whether you have had it before, and if so what made it go away
  •
  •
* Whether you have had any problems with your stomach in the past, such as ulcers, or a hiatus
  hernia.
* Lifestyle, e.g. whether you drink alcohol or smoke
  Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in
  your manual
* This can help you recall details and help the professional identify patterns.
* Nausea could be related to many things. Tracking your symptoms for three days
  may help to identify a pattern.
  Tests
  Tests are not always needed. But your GP or specialist may run further tests such
  as:
* blood tests,
* a stool sample for infection or inflammation,
* camera test (endoscopy) to look at your food pipe and stomach.
  Further Treatments
  Medication
* Doctors and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurse) may change
  your drugs. Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without
  speaking with a healthcare professional.
  See extra information below about some drugs used for this symptom.
* Anti-sickness drugs, e.g. domperidone, cyclizine, ondansetron. Domperidone
  has been shown to be effective in Parkinson’s. But do not use it if you have
  certain heart problems. Do not use it long-term. o Note: Do not use
  metoclopramide and prochlorperazine. They may worsen symptoms of
  Parkinson’s. o Depending on the cause, other drugs may help. For heartburn,
  e.g. gaviscon, omeprazole, lansoprazole.
  See extra information below about some drugs linked to nausea. These may be
  reviewed, along with risks and benefits.
* Most Parkinson’s drugs, e.g. Levodopa
* Some painkillers, e.g. ibuprofen, codeine,
  morphine.
* Some antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin o
  Some drugs used for low mood o Many cancer
  drugs.
  Referral
  You may be referred on to another service, e.g. dietician or gastroenterologist.
  Key Messages
* Nausea can often be linked to starting a new medication either for your Parkinson’s or
  other conditions. If this is the case, the nausea may resolve itself.
* There are lots of things you can do to help nausea.
* If the nausea continues, gets worse or you also get other symptoms, then you should
  seek medical advice.

* Smell: many people with Parkinson’s
  experience smell loss or a reduction in
  their sense of smell.
* Taste: taste is closely linked with
  smell. Some people with Parkinson’s
  notice changes in their sense of taste.
* Touch: touch is not directly affected by
  Parkinson’s. People with Parkinson’s
  can have peripheral neuropathy (a nerve condition) which may be related to
  treatment of Parkinson’s. You might also have increased sensitivity and pain.
* Sight: some people with Parkinson’s experience problems with focusing,
  seeing two of something (double vision), dry eyes, or changes to how they see
  colour. Parkinson’s is not known to cause loss of sight.
* Hearing: research has so far shown mixed results about changes to hearing in
  Parkinson’s.
  Hearing loss is associated with increasing age.
  Sensory changes are important to identify for safety reasons, particularly if you
  drive.
  What might be causing it?
  Smell & Taste
  As described above, smell and taste changes can be directly caused by Parkinson’s.
  Other causes include smoking, past or present infections (e.g. sinusitis, Covid-19),
  and nasal polyps.
  Touch
  Pain and sensitivity caused by Parkinson’s may change in response to Parkinson’s
  medication. For more information see our Pain page.
  Peripheral Neuropathy is a nerve condition that can cause symptoms such as
  reduced sensation, pain or tingling in hands and/or feet. There are many causes
  of peripheral neuropathy. These include: • Diabetes
* Long term alcohol use
* Nutrient deficiencies (e.g. Vitamin B12 deficiency)
  There may be an association between Parkinson’s and peripheral neuropathy, but
  it is not fully understood. This may relate to long-term use of Parkinson’s
  medication and low vitamin B12 levels.
  It is more common in people receiving medication directly into the gut via a feeding tube
  (intraduodenal gel infusion, ‘duodopa’).
  Changes in sense of touch can also be the result of nerve damage or compression
  (e.g. from an injury or arthritis). This is often associated with pain.
  Sight
  Parkinson’s can cause sight changes in a number of ways but many people have no
  problems with their sight.
* Slowing of eye movements can mean eyes don’t move together as well, leading to
  double vision.
* Slowing of eye lid movement means less blinking. This can cause dry, irritated eyes or
  difficulty focusing.
* Spasms of the eyelid muscles can cause involuntary eye closure, called
  blepharospasm.
* Involuntary movements can affect the eye lids leading to involuntary eye closure.
* Some parts of the eye (retinal cells) need dopamine for colour vision. Low levels of
  dopamine in Parkinson’s can cause colours to look subtly dull or similar to one
  another.
* Some medication used in Parkinson’s can cause dry eyes.
* Seeing things that aren’t there is covered separately – see the Hallucinations page.
  These sight changes can also be caused by a range of other conditions. Parkinson’s
  does not tend to cause sudden sight changes. Slow loss of vision is most likely due
  to eye conditions, such as cataracts, glaucoma or macular degeneration.
  Hearing
  A slow deterioration in hearing is common with increasing age. It is possible that
  Parkinson’s may affect:
* Hearing sound. Research is ongoing to understand this more.
* Processing and understanding sound. Some people with Parkinson’s find it difficult to
  listen when multiple people are talking at once. This is made more difficult if you are
  stressed or tired.
  •
  •
  Parkinson’s is not known to cause sudden loss of hearing. Hearing difficulty can be
  caused by a range of other problems, such as build-up of ear wax, age-related hear
  loss (also known as presbycusis) or ear infections.
  What should I do about it?
  There are many things you can try for yourself (see section ‘What can I try for
  myself?’), but there are times when you should seek professional advice.
* Small gradual changes should be assessed routinely.
* You could go to the optician for sight changes o Some opticians offer
  hearing assessments o For other changes, see your GP and let your
  Parkinson’s specialist team know.
* Sudden significant changes in sensory function should be assessed urgently.
* E.g. sudden loss of vision, sudden loss of touch-feeling in a limb
  If you have a new concern about sensory changes, don’t automatically blame it on
  your age or Parkinson’s. Your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team can assess if more
  tests are needed.
  If you are a driver, see the DVLA ‘standards of vision
  for driving’. You don’t need to notify the DVLA about
  changes in colour vision, or about long or short
  sightedness if you can meet these standards. If you
  have other problems with your sight you should
  notify the DVLA. There is more guidance about this
  available on the GOV.UK website.
  What can I try for myself?
  If you have changes in smell and taste
  Although the changes in smell or taste in Parkinson’s cannot be cured, there are
  things to consider.
* It is important to maintain a healthy body weight even if you don’t enjoy food as much.
  See Weight & Appetite Loss and Eating Well pages for more information. If you can’t
  taste as well, perhaps there are different textures that can liven up your food?
* You might be less sensitive to food that has gone past its best. Keep an eye on the
  ‘best before’ dates and label food once opened.
* Safety at home: you may be less sensitive to the smell of a gas leak. Make sure gas
  appliances are serviced regularly and consider getting a gas detector.
* If you smoke, consider stopping.
  If you have changes in vision
* Have your vision checked at your local optician if not done so
  recently. They might find correctable causes. They can also
  recommend referral to a low vision service for support with
  vision aids that can help.
* Make sure there’s good lighting: vision is generally better with
  more light. If your vision is causing trouble getting around at
  night, try night lights.
* Look for reading material in large print format.
* If reading is difficult, how about audio-books (often available from your local library)
  or podcasts?
* The Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) have a large selection of books in
  large print or as audio-books, and can also arrange subscription to magazines and
  newspapers in easy to read formats that are delivered to you (See More Information
  section at the end of this section).
* Assistive technology is an ever-growing field. From screen readers for computers,
  through to talking clocks, there is much out there to ease the impact of sight loss. (See
  More Information at the end of this section)
* If your eyes are dry, you can try eye drops and ointments over-the-counter. Ask your
  pharmacist for more advice.
* Try to blink regularly. People with Parkinson’s often blink less without realising, so may
  need to make more of a conscious effort to blink.
* Safety considerations: be aware of your safety both around the home (e.g. using sharp
  objects) and when out and about (e.g. crossing the road).
* Poor vision might affect your risk of having a fall, for example by tripping
  on a rug or misjudging the depth of steps. See Balance & Falls for tips on
  reducing this risk.
* See ‘What should I do about it?’ above for advice about driving.
  If you have changes in hearing
* Many hearing impairments can improve with hearing aids. The new models now
  available on the NHS are a great improvement on older versions. They have a range of
  types, they are smaller and neater, and they work better. These are usually arranged
  via referral by your GP to an audiology clinic. There are also many private providers
  (including some opticians) that can provide hearing aids.

* Assistive technology can help to ease the impact of hearing loss., such as: o
  Telecommunication devices o Hearing loops o Vibrating alarm clocks o Visual
  doorbells.
* Safety considerations: can you hear alarms? If not, consider visual alarms.
  If you have changes in touch
* Eat a varied diet to ensure adequate nutrient intake. See Eating Well for more
  information.
* Be aware of your skin as you may be less sensitive to changes or injuries. Try to
  routinely check your skin, particularly on the hands and feet, for cuts or damage.
* Safety considerations: be careful with objects that are very hot or very cold as they
  could cause burns without you noticing.
  More general tips to maintain healthy eyes, ears, skin and feet are covered on the
  General Medical Advice page. Practical advice to deal with the impact of sensory
  changes can also be found on the Reading, Writing & Technology page.
  Further Assessment
  Questions
* Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think
  about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to
  bring to the appointment.
  See extra information below about general questions they might ask about any
  sensory change:
* Did the problem come on suddenly over hours or days, or slowly over months or longer?
* Where is affected (e.g. Both sides or one side only)?
* Triggers – things that make the problem worse, or you think might have brought it on?
* Other new symptoms – including other sensory changes, weight loss, headaches, seizures
  (fits), pain, movements, bladder and bowel symptoms.
* Lifestyle questions – including about diet, smoking and alcohol.
* How is it affecting you?
  See extra information below about questions they might ask about for changes in
  vision:
* How is your vision close up (e.g. reading)?
* How is your vision far away (e.g. do you have difficulty recognising someone across the
  road)?
* Does it affect one or both eyes? (try covering each eye in turn to check this out)
* If you have ‘double vision’ are the two images side by side or one on top of the other?
* Do you have any other visual symptoms such as seeing flashing lights or ‘floaters’ (small
  black blobs that move around)?
* Is there a history of vision problems in your family? E.g. Glaucoma.
  See extra information below about questions they might ask about for changes in
  hearing:
* Have other people told you that your hearing is bad, or that you have the TV or radio up
  too loud?
* What do you have trouble hearing? E.g. Difficulty hearing what people are saying in noisy
  places.
* Do you get a ringing or buzzing in your ears (called ‘tinnitus’) or a sensation of the room
  spinning (called ‘vertigo’)?
* Have you had a lot of exposure to loud noise over your life, e.g. through your job?
  See extra information below about questions they might ask about for changes in sense
  of touch:
* Which parts of the body are affected?
* Have you had any injury that could be related?
* Have you had any tingling or pins and needles or pain in the affected area?
* Have you noticed any new weakness in your muscles?
  See extra information below about questions they might ask about for changes in sense
  of taste or smell:
* Is it complete or partial loss of taste/smell? Or is it altered experience of taste/smell?
  (e.g. metallic taste in the mouth).
  •
  •
* Have you had a cold or ‘flu like symptoms?
  Track your symptoms My Tracker in your manual
* This can help you to recall the details of your symptoms.
* If your symptoms come and go, recording them can help
  you to identify patterns. For example, whether the
  symptom might improve with changes in Parkinson’s
  medications.
* The duration of monitoring will depend on how often you
  experience the symptom. You will need a few recordings
  to be able to spot any patterns.
  Tests
  Depending on their assessment, your healthcare professional may wish to run
  further tests. This might be blood tests or scans/tests of nerve function. There is
  no single test that can identify whether a sensory problem is caused by Parkinson’s
  or not.
  Further Treatments
  A healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment.
  Medication
* Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s
  Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
* Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking
  with a healthcare professional.
* If the symptom is thought to be related to Parkinson’s, then changes to your
  Parkinson’s medication may help.
* If the symptom is thought to be a side effect of a Parkinson’s medication (e.g.
  dry eyes from anticholinergic medicine), then a change may be considered.
* Special pain killers may be tried for nerve pain caused by peripheral
  neuropathy.
* Special injections (Botox) may be tried for blepharospasm (spasms of the eyelid
  muscles).
  Referral
* You may be referred on to another service.
  See extra information below about typical
  referrals.
* Audiology for hearing problems
* Ophthalmology or Neuro-ophthalmology for sight problems
* Specialist Neurology services for Botox for blepharospasm
* Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT) for smell or taste problems
* Various specialties could be involved for peripheral neuropathy depending on the
  suspected cause.
  Key Messages
* Sensory changes in smell, taste, touch, sight and/or hearing can be a part of
  Parkinson’s but can have a variety of other causes.
* There are things you can try yourself to help ease the impact of sensory
  changes on your day-to- day life.
* It is important to consider the safety implications of sensory changes.

  Planning Future Care
  Thinking about the future can be scary, but one way of dealing with the fear is to
  take control and plan for it. Everyone gets older. Anyone can become seriously ill.
  The uncertainty of those situations can be less frightening if you have prepared
  for them in advance.
  “Good Housekeeping”

* Consider and convey your wishes
* Write a will
* Appoint a Lasting Power of Attorney
* Organise your documents
  The practical aspects of these topics are discussed in the Practical Advice section
  under Legal Matters. Here we provide guidance on things to consider for the
  future. There are a lot of reasons why people find themselves unable to make or
  share their decisions. In such cases those around them have to take decisions on
  their behalf. Whether you have Parkinson’s or not, recording your future wishes is
  a way to make sure they can be considered when decisions about your care are
  made. Thinking ahead, and sharing your thoughts and wishes with family, friends
  and care professionals can help make sure decisions are based on your personal
  wishes.
  Part of planning for your future may include considering ‘palliative’ and ‘end-of-
  life’ care options.
  What is palliative care?
  Palliative care is treatment, care and support for people with a life-limiting illness.
  The aim of palliative care is to help you to have a good quality of life – this includes
  being as well and active as possible. It can involve:
* managing physical symptoms such as pain
* emotional, spiritual and psychological support
* social care, including help with things like washing, dressing or eating
* support for your family and friends.
  A life-limiting illness is an illness that cannot be cured. You can receive palliative
  care at any stage in your illness. Having palliative care does not necessarily mean
