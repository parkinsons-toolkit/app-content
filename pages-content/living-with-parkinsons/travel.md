Travel
Introduction
This section aims to provide the key information that you should
think about when travelling. This will include key issues around
driving and parking. It will also include other options for getting
around and advice for travelling abroad.
Driving
Being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease does not automatically mean you have to stop driving.
However, there are a number of things that you need to think about to make sure that you and
others are safe on the road.
What should I do?
It is a legal requirement to tell the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) of your medical
condition as soon as possible. It is a criminal offence to not tell the DVLA of a medical condition
that may affect your driving. Not telling them could result in a fine of up to £1,000 or prosecution
if you are involved in an accident. It is also important to discuss your medication with your
Parkinson’s specialist team or GP and how this may affect your ability to drive. This could be, for
example, drowsiness, or feeling too sleepy in the daytime. Not declaring a health condition would
mean your motor insurance is not valid. It is an offense to withhold information from your
insurance company and so they should also be notified. See the Legal Matters page for more
information about insurance.
Will my GP or specialist talk with the DVLA?
You will need to inform the DVLA, as this is not something your healthcare professionals can do.
Healthcare professionals are only allowed to share your personal medical information with your
consent, or if or if there is thought to be a public safety risk. This would be if they think you are
unsafe to drive, for example. If, in such a situation, you continue to drive, they are required to
break confidentiality and notify the DVLA. The DVLA may later ask for further information from
your Parkinson’s specialist or GP with your permission as described below.
How do I inform DVLA?
There are two ways to tell the DVLA:
1. , One option is to report your condition online on the gov.uk website: GOV.UK
2. , The second option is to report your medical condition by completing the “Medical fitness to
Drive” (PK1) form. This can be completed online (GOV.UK) printed and sent via the post, using
the address on the form. If you need a paper copy or more help, contact the DVLA driver medical
enquiries line:
tel: 0300 790 6806
Please note different medical conditions require different forms to be completed – for more information
on this see GOV.UK.
What happens next?
In certain circumstances, the DVLA will sometimes make their decision based only on the
information provided from the PK1 form. DVLA state that they typically provide a decision within
6 weeks. If they require more information before making a decision you will receive a letter
informing you the decision is still ongoing.
To help form their decision the DVLA may:
 Contact your GP or Parkinson’s specialist for their medical opinion
 Ask you to go for a medical examination. This will typically be with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist
 Ask for you to take a driving assessment to assess current ability.
Can I still drive whilst waiting for decision?
Under section 88 of The Road Traffic Act 1998 you may be allowed to continue driving whilst waiting
for a decision. In order to continue driving whilst waiting you must meet all of the following criteria:
 Your doctor must have told you that you are fit to drive.
 You held a valid driving license and only drive the vehicles that you were allowed to before you
informed the DVLA
 If you drive a bus or lorry (Group 2 licence), your licence has not been withdrawn, suspended or
refused by a traffic commissioner
 You meet all the conditions that are set out on your previous licence that still apply
 DVLA has received your application (PK1 or PK1V) within the last 12 months
 Your previous licence was not cancelled or refused due to medical reasons
 A court has not currently disqualified you from driving
 Your licence was not withdrawn as the result of being a high risk offender on or after 1st June 2013.
A high risk offender is defined as a driver convicted of a serious drink driving offence.
The DVLA will not let you know if you fit the Section 88 criteria. Therefore, it is the responsibility
of yourself and your doctor to consider whether you are safe to drive whilst waiting for the DVLA’s
decision.
The decision
The DVLA will typically inform you of one of four decisions:
1) Your current license will remain without any restrictions
You can continue to drive as you have done before without any expiry date, review or adaptations
needed. However, if symptoms change or get worse you will need to let the DVLA know.
2) A new short-term medical driving license is issued
You can continue to drive as you have done before but the decision will be reviewed again by the
DVLA when the short term license expires. The DVLA offer 1, 2, 3 or 5 year short-term medical
licenses.
3) Your licence is restricted to vehicles with specific adaptions
If you are required to adapt your car as part of the DVLA decision, you can visit a mobility centre
for an independent assessment and equipment.
4) Your licence is no longer valid and you cannot legally drive
If the DVLA’s decision is that you can no longer drive, they will give you an overview of how they
came to that decision, and the reason why. They will also tell you if you can reapply for a
reassessment in the future. Any fees linked with the application process will be refunded.
However, if you do not agree with the decision because the information provided was not
understood correctly or you feel it is not a true reflection of your condition, you have a right to
appeal. The DVLA decision letter will outline the details of who you can contact. You will need to
give the reasons why you feel the original decision was wrong.
You may need to have a new medical examination or driving assessment in order for the DVLA to
reconsider their decision. If you do not agree with their second decision you have a right to appeal
to the magistrates’ court. This appeal must be made within 6 months from when the license was
taken away or refused. You must inform the DVLA that you will be appealing to the court. For
more information please read the Legal Matters document.
Summary of the decision making process
1. Inform DVLA of your health condition.
2. Discuss with your Parkinson’s specialist or GP if you can continue to drive while waiting for DVLA’s
decision.
3. Wait for DVLA’s decision (this typically happens within six weeks). You may be asked to have a medical
or driving assessment.
4. You receive DVLA’s decision:
- If they decide YES: you can continue to drive under the conditions they outline in the decision
letter.
- If they decide NO: you can appeal for a reassessment, appeal to local magistrates court within
six months, or stop driving.
What can I try for myself?
As already stated, you must inform DVLA of your medical condition. These are some suggestions for
maintaining your safety as a driver:
1. Talk with your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP about how your medications may effect driving.
If you feel very sleepy in the daytime you can discuss options of different medications or dosages.
2. Book yourself for regular sight and hearing tests. Make sure you have any aids that would help
you when driving.
3. Avoid distractions – Parkinson’s can affect your ability to do several things at once; it is important
that you keep your attention on the road.
4. Look into options of cars with adaptations that may make driving easier. These might be steering
aids or hand controls. You can visit a mobility centre for advice.
5. Driving can be stressful and stress worsens symptoms of Parkinson’s. Try to reduce this stress by
planning your route in advance and allowing yourself plenty of time.
Parking
As Parkinson’s can affect your walking this section aims to provide you with helpful information and
options. These will help make it possible to park closer to the services and places that you are visiting.
What can I do?
The Blue Badge Scheme
The Blue Badge Scheme aims to help people with mobility issues (as either the driver or passenger
of a car) to park closer to their destination. The blue badge is linked to the individual rather than
a vehicle and so can be used in any car you are travelling in. This includes hire cars or taxis.
The key benefits to getting a Blue Badge is that it lets you park for free:
- In designated disabled parking bays on streets for as long as needed, unless the sign
posting indicates a time limit.
- On streets with parking meters or pay and display for as long as needed, unless the
sign posting indicates a time limit.
- On single or double yellow lines for up to 3 hours
- Can be exempt from the congestion charge in Central London – there is an
administration fee.
These benefits and parking rules apply to most of the UK but not everywhere in the UK. Examples
of where there are different schemes include some airports, e.g. Heathrow Airport, and some
central London boroughs, e.g. City of Westminster. The Government website GOV.UK has more
information.
Please check with local boroughs guidelines for parking schemes.
It is also important to know that the Blue Badge is for street parking. You will
need to check the signs for private parking to see if you still have to pay. Such places would be
parking in hospitals or supermarkets. You will still have to follow all other standard parking
regulations.
Who is entitled to a blue badge?
Some individuals can receive automatic qualification whilst other people may have to qualify
through an assessment.
See extra information below about current edibility criteria for automatic qualification.
Any one of:
- In receipt of the higher rate of the mobility component within the Disability Living Allowance
- In receipt of a personal independence payment because you cannot walk more than 500
metres (Score of 8 points or less for the “moving around” activity).
- In receipt of the mobility component of the Personal independence payment and obtain 10
points for the “planning and following journey’s activity”.
- Receiving the War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement
- Been certified as having permanent and substantial disability which impacts inability to walk
and have received a lump sum benefit within the tariff levels 1-8 of the Armed Forces and
Research Forces compensation scheme
See extra information section about what might make you eligible for assessment for the blue
badge scheme.
If one or more of the following situations applies:
- Unable to walk
- Experience difficulty in walking due to pain, breathlessness or in need of support of
someone / mobility aids
- Be at serious risk to yourself or others when walking
You might be asked to do a mobility assessment. This is where a health professional assesses your mobility
and lets the council know if they think you need a Blue Badge or not.
If your condition improves and you no longer need the Blue Badge, you must return the badge to the
council or you could be fined.
How do I apply for a Blue Badge?
You can apply for your blue badge on the gov.uk website. This will direct you to your local
council site to apply online. Someone else can apply on your behalf, but they will need to have
access to your supporting documents (e.g. proof of identity, proof of address, a passport-sized
photo and your supporting evidence). You will usually need to provide some supporting evidence
of your medical condition. This might include a letter from your specialist, a summary of your
health conditions from your GP or a letter from a social worker, for example. Your council website
will tell you what you will need to provide. Some local councils will provide a telephone helpline
to assist you in your application, or will let you also apply by post. Please check with local council.
There is a small fee for the blue badge.
The badge will typically last up to 3 years before you will have to renew. You must apply for a renewal
before the old one expires: The council will usually aim to make a decision within 12 weeks.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“She also advised me about a Blue Badge. And, I went on the internet, filled the form in, and
within a matter of 5 weeks, I had a blue badge.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Parking website
BlueBadgeParking.com Is a worldwide crowd-sourced database of disabled parking places. The database
is edited by the general public to add disabled parking bays that are not on the website.
This also exists as an app.
What can I try for myself?
1. Check eligibility and apply for a Blue Badge
2. Plan ahead and check if disabled parking bays are available
- This could be done by using BlueBadgeParking.com. or,
- Phoning the place you are visiting
3. Make sure you display your BlueBadge correctly on the dashboard showing the hologram and
parking clock.
Using public transport
There are other transport options, other than driving, that have travel schemes to encourage you
to still get around and make travelling easier. These schemes may be used to help you get to
hospital appointments, supermarkets or a friend’s house. The idea is also so that travel does not
prevent you from doing what you would like to do day-to-day, as much as possible.
What can I do?
Bus Travel
- ‘Disabled Person’s Bus Passes’ are
available across England.
- You will need to contact your local council
to find out who issues disabled bus
passes in your area.
- In London it is a Disabled Person’s
‘Freedom Pass’ rather than ‘Bus Pass’.
- The government website GOV.UK allows you to search for the relevant part of your local
council website according to your postcode: search for “Disabled person bus pass” on the
government website.
- More information about the Freedom Pass for London is available on the London Councils
website – see the Freedom Pass section (within “Services”) for more details.
- See extra information below about current eligibility.
- You have been refused a driving license because of your health
- Have a severe learning disability
- You do not have arms or cannot use your arms
- Struggle to walk very far because of a disability or illness
- You are partially sighted or blind, deaf or unable to speak.
Rail travel
- People with a disability that impacts mobility or makes travelling by train difficult may be eligible for
the ‘Disabled Persons Railcard’.
- You pay for the Railcard, then you and your companion can receive a third off the cost of most train
journeys.
- See extra information below for current eligibility criteria for the Disabled persons railcard.
- Receive Personal independence Payment (PIP)
- Receive higher or lower rate for the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA)
- Receive higher or middle rare for the care component of Disability Living Allowance (DLA)

- Receive War or Service Disablement Pension for 80% or more disability
- Use the Motability scheme to buy or lease a vehicle
- Have a visual or hearing impairment
- Have epilepsy
For more information and applications, go to www.railcard.co.uk
Dial-a-ride
- Most councils have a ‘dial-a-ride’ service run by the local council or charity organisation.
- Dial-a-ride is a door to door service to take people where they may want or need to go to.
- This may be to go to the supermarket or to a hospital appointment.
- This is designed to help people who are older or have a permanent disability and other transport
options may be difficult.
- You can find your local council’s website by entering your postcode on the government website, under
“find local council”.
- The TFL London Dial-a-ride membership can be applied to by permanent or temporary residents of
London boroughs. Membership and service are currently free. More information and applications are
available on the TFL website, search ‘Dial a ride’.
- Some applications will require you to provide further information or possibly undergo a mobility
assessment to see if you qualify to use that service.
Taxicard
- Some councils across England offer a ‘Taxicard’ scheme where journeys using taxis are subsidised
so that you pay cheaper fares than normal.
- As for many of these services, you will need to contact your local council to see what is offered
locally. You can find your local council’s website by entering your postcode on the government
website, under “find local council”.
- More information about the London Taxicard is available on the London Councils website – see
the Taxicard section (within “Services”) for more information and applications.
- Some applications will require you to provide further information or possibly undergo a mobility
assessment to see if you qualify to use that service. The application process typically takes
between 6-8 weeks.
Motability
- ‘Motability’ is a nationwide scheme that allows you to lease a scooter, powered wheelchair or
new car (with wheelchair accessible options or adaptations). This is in exchange for your
higher rate mobility allowance.
- See extra information below about current eligibility.
You must receive one of the following and have at least 12 months’ of your allowance remaining:
- Receive the higher rate of the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance
- Receive the enhanced mobility rate of the Personal Independence Payment
- In receipt of a War Pension Mobility Supplement
- Receive the mobility element of the Armed Forces Independence Payment
Please note that Attendance Allowance cannot be used to lease a car through Motability scheme.
- You do not need to be the driver of the vehicle and can have up to 3 named drivers; so that
the car could be driven by a family member, friend or carer.
- More information, applications and vehicle search is available on the Motability website, or
via telephone on 0300 456 4566.
What can I try for myself?
1. Check eligibility of each scheme and apply for the schemes you believe are worthwhile
2. Take the time to plan your trips as some transport requires booking in advance.
3. Applying for more than one scheme means that you will have multiple options of getting
around. E.g. If dial-a-ride is not available then you can use your Taxicard.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“…the chance to meet with a colleague's neighbour who had had Parkinson's for some
time. Seeing him still enjoying life - driving, working, travelling - was a big step to helping
me get back on my feet after the diagnosis.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Finding toilets
Parkinson’s can make getting to the toilet trickier, either due to walking difficulties or bladder symptoms.
This can cause problems when out and about.
National Key Scheme
This system allows people with a disability to unlock more than 9,000 accessible public toilets
across the UK. If finding toilets is a concern that may prevent you from getting around, this scheme
aims to ease these concerns by making many more toilets accessible to you. See the Disability
Rights UK website for more information and to buy a key, known as a ‘Radar Key’, and region list.
You may also find the Urinary Symptoms pages helpful.
Flying & travelling abroad
Flying and travelling abroad with Parkinson’s is still possible, with many people still enjoying
breaks and holidays. The condition should not stop you from arranging new holidays in the future.
There are some extra things to think about when planning that can help to reduce potential
worries.
Am I safe to travel?
- It is recommended that you speak with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team about your
travel plans so they can provide their advice. This may include how to best manage medication
whilst you are away.
- It is wise to take an extra week’s worth of medication with you. Keep this in your carry-on
baggage in case of lost baggage or delays.
- Discuss about how you continue your medication regime, especially if travelling to a different
time zone.
- Always carry medicines and medical equipment in their original, correctly labelled packages.
- Your GP can provide you with a medical letter or medical summary outlining that you have
Parkinson’s and the medication you are taking. This might be needed if you feel ill whilst
abroad or if you are stopped at security or customs. Please note your GP practice may charge
for writing such a letter, as this service is not typically covered by the NHS. Alternatively, you
could take a copy of a recent letter from a visit to your specialist if it contains up to date details
of your condition and medications.
- Having a medical letter outlining your condition and
medications is also a good idea if you have been
prescribed tablets for sleep, anxiety, or pain. These
medications are closely monitored in the UK and other
countries.
- It is recommended that you inform the company you are
travelling with of your condition at least 48 hours before you go. This will allow the company
to provide the best possible support to you during your journey.
Can I fly?
- Parkinson’s does not stop someone from flying. It is
important however to consider that symptoms may make it
more difficult (e.g. stiffness or walking problems) or be
made worse (e.g. anxiety, sleep).
- If you are flying, it is important to stay hydrated to reduce
symptoms. Therefore, drink plenty of fluids to prevent
dehydration.
- You may want to book a seat at the front of the plane, or in a seat where you can have extra
leg room
- It is against the law within England and Europe for an airline to prevent anyone booking or
boarding a flight due to a disability.
Going abroad
- There could be instances where you will need to get medical assistance whilst on holiday.
Think about how you could access this in advance.
- Go to the gov.uk website and look under ‘foreign travel advice’ for specific country advice, or
contact the embassy of the country you intend to visit.
- If you need immunisations for your holiday, see the GP or private travel clinic at least 8 weeks
before you’re due to travel o Some vaccines need time to develop immunity o Others need
multiple doses given over weeks or months o You can see more information on the NHS
website – “travel vaccinations” o Or you can look on the NHS ‘Fit for Travel’ website for more
detailed, country-specific information on recommended vaccines
- Until the 31st December 2020, the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) allows you free or
subsidised treatment across the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. This is not a
replacement or alternative to travel insurance. You should have both. For more information
or to apply for an EHIC, see the government website, searching “EHIC”.
- There are similar agreements that the UK has with other countries in regards to free or
subsidised treatment costs.
- Note: travel insurance is covered in Legal Matters.
What can I try for myself?
1. Talk with your GP about your travel plans and seek advice
- Discuss medication management
- Ask about a medical letter outlining your conditions and medication, particularly if you are
taking medications prescribed by your doctor for pain, anxiety or sleep
2. Carry medicines and medical equipment in their original, correctly labelled packages.
3. Bring one additional week’s worth of medications with you in your carry-on baggage. This is in case
of delays or lost baggage.
4. Contact the company you are travelling with at least 48 hours before to inform them you have
Parkinson’s so they can provide necessary support needed.
5. Keep well hydrated and drink fluids regularly on any type of journey, especially if you are flying.
6. Apply for your Global Health Insurance Card, these have now replaced the European Health
Insurance Card. Please note these do not replace travel insurance.
7. Seek medical treatment if unwell when abroad
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I take sealed bottles of spares medication on any trip abroad. I take one in my hand
baggage and one in my hold luggage. If something happens to either my hand luggage or
hold luggage, I still have medication. If nothing happens to either, then I have extra which
is handy if I get severely delayed because volcanic ash or a worldwide pandemic
halts air travel.” (Person with Parkinson’s)

Work and Caring
Introduction
A diagnosis of Parkinson’s does not mean you have to leave your job or not work again. Many
people with Parkinson’s can still work. The important thing to consider is how the symptoms of
Parkinson’s may impact your work and day-to-day life.
Working with Parkinson’s
Depending on the type of work you do, different Parkinson’s symptoms may cause you challenges.
For example:
- Getting around the workplace may be difficult due to mobility or tiredness
- Sitting for long periods may cause you to feel dizzy when standing
- Physical tasks may be hard to complete due to fatigue or motor symptoms
- Public speaking may be challenging due to changes in speech, movements or confidence
- Writing or using technology may be harder due
to motor symptoms
- Working long hours can increase fatigue and
cause symptoms to vary.
This should not stop you from working if you wish
to continue. You may need to adapt your job slightly
or find ways to manage these work-related issues.
For more advice, see our Symptom
Management pages and Reading, Writing & Technology
page.
You can speak to your GP or specialist about ways to help you better manage your symptoms for
the type of work you do.
Talking to colleagues
Do I need to tell my employer?
It can be tough deciding whether to tell your employer about your condition. For the most part, it
is your decision whether you inform your employer. But there are certain situations where you
should tell your employer:
- If your disability can cause a health and safety risk to yourself or others. For example, if you are a
driver.
