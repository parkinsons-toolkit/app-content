When diagnosed with Parkinson’s, you may want to seek out extra information to that given by the health professionals supporting you. This can help you to better understand the condition and understand how to manage any symptoms. There are a number of places you can find information. This can be on the internet, from applications (‘apps’), in books, libraries, information organisations such as Citizens Advice, and from support groups. There can be a huge amount of information to take in. This can be especially so when searching the internet or when downloading health apps to your electronic device. The information may seem to be contradictory, and it can sometimes feel confusing to know what information is accurate. It can also be hard to know what information to use for yourself. It is always good to ask the health professionals around you any questions you have, and about the extra information you have found.

This section provides guidance on the different sources of information and some examples of good sources of information.

## Websites

There are a lot of websites offering information. Be cautious about carrying out general internet searches and using information from any website without checking that is it accurate and safe. Try to get your information from known reliable sources. Such sources would be government and NHS websites and reputable charities such as Parkinson’s UK and the Cure Parkinson’s Trust in this country. There is also the Parkinson’s Foundation and the Michael J Fox Foundation based in the U.S. but with an international reach.

### Parkinson’s UK

<a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> is the leading Parkinson’s charity in the UK. It offers ongoing support for people diagnosed with Parkinson’s and their family members with a network of local advisors and a telephone helpline. The website provides information sheets and latest research updates. It also offers the ‘First Steps’ course for people newly diagnosed with Parkinson’s.

### Cue Parkinson's Trust

The <a href="https://www.cureparkinsons.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cure Parkinson's Trust</a> is a smaller UK based charity which is dedicated to supporting research to slow, stop and reverse Parkinson’s. Whether you are interested in taking part in research yourself or just wanting to keep up to date with developments, this is a good place to look.

### GOV.UK

<a href="https://www.gov.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a> is where you can find information regarding government policies and your local services. Any updates in law changes or policies will be found on the government website.

### NHS

## Apps

An app is a type of software that allows you to perform specific tasks. These can be downloaded to your mobile phone or other electronic device. There are some apps designed to help you deal with your day-to-day symptoms of Parkinson’s. It is difficult to know if an app is useful based on good scientific knowledge and they may be discontinued. However, below are some examples of apps that you may find useful.

### 'Our Mobile Health'

Our Mobile Health is an organisation made up of health professionals and experts that review and identify the best health-related apps to be used by people. Our Mobile Health worked with Parkinson’s UK to provide a list of recommended apps:

_NHS and 'Our Mobile Health' recommended apps:_

_Mental Health_

- Stress & Anxiety Companion: Provides you with breathing exercises to reduce anxiety as well as games and music for relaxation.
- WorryTree: Based on Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). The app allows you to record any worries and challenge these.
- Pzizz: Promotes and encourages better quality of sleep using relaxing noises and music. Aims to quieten your mind to make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep.
- Beat Panic: Uses positive messages and colours to help reduce anxiety (Note: currently costs 99p).
- Cove: Allows you to create music to reflect your emotions. Allows you to express your feeling without having to use words and keeps a personal journal of how you have felt. This is being tested in the NHS.

_Speech_

- Beats Medical: Aims to help with your Parkinsonian symptoms – such as mobility, speech and dexterity.
- Swallow Prompt: Provides reminders to people who may have difficulty remembering to swallow without being prompted. You can set how often you receive the reminder depending on your personal situation.
- Voice Analyst: Allows you to record your voice and analyse potential changes in pitch and volume over time.

## Electronic Devices

- **Pathfinder:** Pathfinder is a device that attaches to your shoes and provides a laser on the floor. The laser provides a visual cue for the person to continue walking and may reduce the number of times that you freeze. It may also reduce shuffling and improve walking.

## How to know if information is reliable

Some of the above may be classed as medical devices. Medical devices are devices that are intended to be used for medical purposes. When looking for medical devices that you think may help you, it is important to see if the product has been assessed by the government. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will test medical devices. If the device is judged to be satisfactory and given approval, then the device will be marked with “CE”. If you see any products with the “CE” mark, then you can have confidence that it has been assessed and approved by the government.

If you are looking for apps that could be useful, it is recommended to either try the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/apps-library/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS app library</a> or <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/apps-and-devices-parkinsons" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Our Mobile Health’</a>. Be cautious about just using commercial app stores. If looking for information on the internet be cautious about carrying out general internet searches and using information from any website. Try getting your information from known reliable sources such as the websites and charities mentioned above.

Remember that each person diagnosed with Parkinson’s will experience the condition differently.

This means that not everything you read will apply to you. It is always worth talking with your GP or the health professionals around you to discuss what information, devices, websites or apps they feel may help you.
