# Appointments & Hospital Stays

---

## Appointments

Most people with Parkinson’s remain under the care of a specialist (usually a Neurologist or Geriatrician) for life. They usually see them every 6–12 months. In addition, many areas have Parkinson’s Nurse Specialists, either in the community or hospital. Some hold outpatient appointments, most do telephone calls, and a few will visit people at home. You may also have appointments with other teams, either for Parkinson’s or other health reasons.

Appointments can be stressful, and stress tends to make Parkinson’s symptoms worse. Planning ahead can help reduce this stress and make the most of the appointment. Here are some things to consider:

### Do you want someone to come with you?

This could be someone you trust—for emotional support, help remembering what is said, or to describe your experience if they know you well. It’s your choice whether they come into the appointment or wait outside.

### How will you get there?

- Check directions in advance and allow plenty of time.
- Appointment letters from hospitals often include directions and a contact number.
- **Hospital transport:** Available in specific circumstances. This must be planned ahead. Check your appointment letter or call the number provided to book transport.

### Do you need an interpreter?

- Hospitals and GP surgeries can provide interpretation services, but this must be arranged in advance.
- Check your appointment letter or call the contact number to request an interpreter.

### What do you want out of the appointment?

- Think ahead about your expectations and questions.
- Write questions down in advance.
- Prioritise concerns if there’s limited time—numbering your list can help.

### What to bring

- Medication you may need while there, and some water.
- An up-to-date list of medication or the original packets.
- Your written list of questions.
- Pen and paper (or digital equivalent) for notes.
- Any relevant documents or letters from other professionals.
- Something to read or listen to while waiting.
- A snack and drink—hospitals can be warm, and waiting times long.

**Note:** Even if staff don’t review your documents at one appointment, they might at the next. It’s better to be over-prepared than to face delays due to missing information.

---

## Staying in Hospital

Hospital stays can be planned (Elective Admission) or unplanned (Emergency Admission). Either way, it's essential staff know you have Parkinson’s to provide appropriate care.

### Medication

The hospital must follow your usual medication schedule. Let staff know exactly what times you take your medication.

### Preparation

- If a planned stay is coming up, discuss it with your Parkinson’s specialist team.
- Carry an alert card or wear a bracelet to indicate you have Parkinson’s.
- Keep vital health documents together for emergencies.

### What to bring

- **Medication:** A short supply in original packaging, plus a list of when you take them.
- **Documents:** Any key letters or reports from healthcare professionals. Also, contact details for your Parkinson’s team.
- **Aids:** Hearing aids, glasses, dentures, walking stick, etc.
- **Clothes & toiletries:** Day clothes, pyjamas, dressing gown, slippers, toothbrush, flannel, shampoo, etc.
- **Comfort items:** Photos, music, or a tablet/smartphone to stay in touch with loved ones. Hospital staff can help you use these if needed.

---

## Sharing Information

On admission, you will be asked for personal and medical details. These include:

- Reason for your admission
- Other health conditions
- Medications and **timing** (especially Parkinson’s meds)
- Allergies
- Living situation
- Support at home (people, equipment, and aids)

Make sure to:

- Clearly state you have Parkinson’s.
- Provide contact info for your Parkinson’s team (they may liaise with the hospital).
- Consider preparing an “About Me” and “My Health” summary to avoid repeating information to multiple staff.

### Advanced or Experimental Treatments

If you are using an **advanced therapy** (e.g. infusion pump, deep brain stimulation) or participating in an experimental treatment:

- Inform staff **as soon as possible**.
- These therapies may not be familiar to staff, and special arrangements may be needed.
- Carry treatment details and contact info for the responsible team.
- Follow any hospital advice provided by the specialist team managing your therapy.

**Advanced Therapies Include:**
- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
- Apomorphine pump
- Intraduodenal levodopa gel infusion (e.g. Duodopa)

---

It’s important for staff to know that you have Parkinson’s and to understand your individual needs, including:

- **Dietary needs** and any assistance with food and drink
- **Personal care** support (e.g., toileting, washing, dressing)
- **Sleep patterns and needs**
- **Medication timing** – Parkinson’s medication must be taken on schedule, which might differ from standard hospital routines. Inform staff of your schedule.

> Some hospitals have self-medication policies. If you self-administer your medication, **let healthcare staff know**.

---

## Who’s Who?

You'll encounter many professionals during your hospital stay. See “Who May Be Involved” for role descriptions. Always feel free to ask about someone's role.

---

## Responsibilities Outside Hospital

You may worry about responsibilities left behind. Minimising these worries can support your recovery.

- **Work**: Inform your workplace, or ask someone to do it for you.
- **Dependents**: Arrange alternative care. Social services can help with vulnerable adults/children. [NHS Social Care Guide](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/social-care-and-support-guide/)
- **Pets**: Arrange someone to care for them.
- **Security/Safety**: Ask someone to check your home if needed.
- **Bills**: Ask someone to handle urgent payments.

See **Work & Caring** and **Hobbies & Pets** for more advice.

---

## Minimising Hospital Risks

### Medication Safety

- Ensure staff know your **Parkinson’s medication schedule**.
- Ask about any **changes to your regimen**.
- Report any **medication errors** to staff immediately.
- Clarify questions:
  - About **why**: ask the **doctor** (prescriber)
  - About **what**: ask the **nurse** administering
  - **Pharmacists** can advise on both
- **Never stop Parkinson’s medication suddenly** – even when fasting. Confirm if meds can be taken NBM (Nil By Mouth). Some can be given via **tube** or **skin patch**.

---

### Infection Control

- Encourage visitors to follow **infection control** measures (e.g., handwashing).
- Maintain **personal hygiene** – ask for help if needed.

---

### Deconditioning

Prolonged rest can weaken the body. Combat this by:

- Eating and drinking well
- Being as **independent** as possible
- **Moving** regularly, even in bed
- **Sitting during the day** and **sleeping at night**
- Reporting pain to avoid inactivity

Hospital meals may not suit your taste or timing. Tips:

- Ask family to bring food (if allowed)
- Inform staff of any **dietary restrictions**
- Request help with eating/drinking
- Keep **a drink nearby** and sip regularly

---

### Constipation

Maintain hydration and a healthy diet to avoid constipation. If constipated, alert staff for early treatment.

---

### Falls Prevention

- Inform staff about your support needs
- Learn how to **call for help** (usually a button)
- Use **appropriate footwear**
- Stand slowly to prevent dizziness

---

### Delirium

Delirium = confusion caused by illness or stress. Symptoms include fluctuating alertness, orientation, and sleep disruption.

**Causes:**
- Infections
- Medication interactions
- Abnormal blood chemistry
- Pain, dehydration, sleep deprivation
- Surgery or anaesthetic

**Tips to Help:**
- Staff/visitors should reintroduce themselves regularly
- Use orientation aids (clock, date, photos, newspapers)
- Maintain normal **sleep-wake** cycles
- Stay **hydrated**

---

### Surgery Considerations

- Tell your **anaesthetist** you have Parkinson’s – it affects anaesthetic and pain relief choices.
- Ask if you can take meds even when fasting. They may be administered via **tube** or **patch**.
- Inform staff if meds cause side effects.

---

## Hospital Policies

Hospital rules vary. Always ask staff or check the website for specific info.

### Single Rooms

Not standard. Allocated based on **infection risk**, **privacy needs**, or **monitoring requirements**. If unsure why you’re in a certain room, ask.

You may be placed in a **close observation ward** with others who need close monitoring, such as people with dementia.

---

### Blood Clot Risk

All patients are assessed for **blood clot risk**. You may be prescribed **daily injections** of blood thinners.

---

### Infection Control

Staff should **wash hands** or use gel between patients. In some cases, gloves/masks are also used.

**Visitors** should also use hand gel and may be asked to wear protective gear.

> 💬 If a nurse does not wash hands before attending you, **you have the right to ask them to do so.**

---

# Discharge from Hospital

## Support

Before you leave hospital, there are various plans that need to be put in place:

Has there been a change in what you are able to do that might mean you should have different support at home? This might be temporary while you continue to recover. It might be longer term.

A range of professionals can assess your needs. This will consider tasks you undertake in your daily life. The professional who will complete this will depend on the circumstances.

### My Experience

> *"So, they said they could make sure he can get up a couple of steps. And I think the stair-lift had to be fitted before he come home. And they had to assess the house and all that."*
> *(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)*

---

## Medication

There is a process of providing a list of medication that you should be taking on discharge from the hospital. Also for providing sufficient supply if you do not already have it.

It is important that the hospital team lets you, your GP and Parkinson’s specialist team know of any medication changes. They should also include the reasons for any changes.

> Bear in mind it can take a week or so for the GP to be made aware of any medicine changes. You may need to talk to your GP soon after discharge to go through these changes.

---

## Follow-up Appointments

You may need further medical input to follow-up after your admission. This may be at the hospital or via your GP. In some cases the exact appointment will not be made before you leave hospital.

Make sure you understand what the plan is:

* Are you to make an appointment with your GP yourself?
* Are you to expect a letter about a hospital appointment?

> It is important to communicate any changes in your living arrangements to ensure that appointment information is sent to the correct place.

---

## Decision Making

Decisions about health and care should be taken together with your healthcare professional. This is **shared decision making**.

The healthcare professional gives you advice, and **you have the final decision**. This does not mean you can demand a treatment that is not recommended, but that you are in control of your care.

Sometimes thinking and memory problems can interfere with a person’s ability to make decisions. If this is the case, they may be said to **lack capacity**.

> Capacity can vary by decision and over time. See **Legal Matters** for more info.

If someone lacks capacity to consent to the hospital admission and care, and they require constant supervision, then a legal process called **Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DOLS)** must be followed. This ensures decisions are taken in their best interests.

In some cases, this may involve keeping them in hospital even if they want to go home.

### Power of Attorney

Some people will have a **Power of Attorney** in place. Healthcare professionals will include them in decision making.
See **Legal Matters** for more info.

### Mental Health Act

If someone has a mental health problem that puts them or others at serious risk, the **Mental Health Act** may be used to make health decisions for them.
