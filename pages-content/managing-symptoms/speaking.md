# Speech Difficulties in Parkinson’s

Speech difficulties are common in Parkinson’s, though not everyone will experience all the issues discussed here. Common problems include a quiet, slurred, or hoarse voice, monotone speech, and difficulty with tongue and lip movements. Some people feel as though they are speaking through a “mask.”

## Causes of Speech Problems

- Parkinson’s causes changes in the brain, leading to smaller, less forceful movements which can affect the voice.
- Cognitive changes may slow thought processes or make it difficult to find the right words.
- Many people with Parkinson’s are unaware that they speak quietly.
- Other potential causes:
  - Issues with the mouth, throat, or jaw (e.g., poorly fitting dentures or throat infections)
  - Other medical conditions affecting the brain (e.g., stroke)
- Speech changes in Parkinson’s tend to develop gradually. Sudden changes are less likely related to Parkinson’s.

## What to Do

- Try strategies to improve speech yourself.
- If symptoms are progressing or affecting your life, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
- **Seek urgent help if:**
  - A new hoarse voice lasts more than three weeks → see your GP
  - Sudden changes in speech with weakness on one side of the face → call 999 (possible stroke)

### Speech Techniques

- Relax and ensure good posture before speaking.
- Imagine speaking to someone at the back of a large room to encourage volume.
- Speak slowly and clearly, emphasizing key words.
- Simplify sentences where possible.

### Everyday Speech Exercises

- **Singing:**
  - Social and fun way to increase vocal confidence
  - Singing exercises improve voice and breathing muscles
  - Classes are available across the UK, or you can sing at home
- **Socialising:** Practice speech in social situations to build confidence
- **Reading aloud:** Stories, poetry, or news can exercise speech
- **Apps:** Decibel-monitoring apps help gauge speaking volume (normal conversation: 60–70 dB). Ask a therapist for guidance.

### Example from Experience

> “I had one gentleman who loved telling stories to his grandchildren. So I said, ‘Why don’t you record them, and if you record it loud enough, that’s your exercise.’” – Speech & Language Therapist

## Further Assessment

### Questions Healthcare Professionals Might Ask

- Problems swallowing food, drink, or medicines?
- Weakness in arms or legs?
- Unintentional weight loss?
- Concerns about memory?
- Sore throat?
- Hearing changes?
- Lifestyle: smoking and alcohol

### Tracking Symptoms

- Use a Symptom and Activity Tracker for 3–5 days.
- Record:
  - When speech is most and least problematic
  - Activities at the time
  - Medication timing

### Tests

- Most cases do not require tests.
- Possible tests: blood tests, head/neck scans, camera tests of throat and vocal cords.

## Further Treatments

### Referral

- Speech and language therapists → focus on voice, clarity, and volume
- Physiotherapists → assist with stiffness, strength, and body language
- Other specialists (ENT) if non-Parkinson’s cause suspected

### Medication

- Parkinson’s medications (e.g., levodopa) may improve speech
- Voice may be stronger when medications are effective and weaker when they are not
- **Do not change medications without consulting a healthcare professional**

## Key Messages

- Parkinson’s can cause speech problems but is not the only cause
- Early consultation with a Speech and Language Therapist is recommended
