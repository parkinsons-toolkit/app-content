# Sexual Function

Sexual problems can happen with Parkinson’s, but not everyone will experience these. Some people notice changes physically, emotionally, or with sexual drive.

Many people do not feel comfortable talking about sex, meaning sexual problems may be missed and not addressed.

## What Might Be Causing It?

At times, it is completely normal to have issues with sex. Different factors can influence it, including tiredness and mood. Normal ageing also causes physical changes that affect the ability to have or enjoy sex.  

- **Women after menopause:** Lower oestrogen levels can cause less lubrication and sometimes vaginal sensitivity or inflammation, making sex painful.  
- **Health conditions & medicines:** Pain from arthritis, pelvic problems after childbirth, diabetes, heart disease, smoking, and excess alcohol can all affect sexual function.

### Parkinson’s-Specific Factors

- **Movement problems:** Slowed movements or difficulties coordinating movements  
- **Fatigue:** Can lower sex drive (libido)  
- **Bladder or bowel problems:** May make you or your partner nervous about sexual activity  
- **Medication:** Some medications (e.g., antidepressants) can impact sexual desire, arousal, and ability to orgasm  
- **Reduced sex drive:** Psychological and emotional effects of managing a long-term condition, Parkinson’s itself, tiredness, and depression  
- **Reduced arousal & orgasm:** Parkinson’s can affect sexual function  
- **Confidence issues**

**Note:** Some Parkinson’s medicines (dopamine agonists) can cause **hypersexuality**—a marked increase in sexual interest, arousal, and behaviour. See the Impulsive Behaviours page for more information.

## What Should I Do About It?

Sexual function issues are sometimes normal and may improve on their own. If they don’t, you can try self-help strategies or speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. These conversations are private and confidential, and medication changes may help.

**Hypersexuality:** Mild increases may be manageable for some couples, but if sexual desires feel out of control or cause behavioural changes, speak to your Parkinson’s specialist urgently.
