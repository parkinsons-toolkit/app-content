# **Sexual Problems in Parkinson’s**

Sexual difficulties are common but not universal. They can be **physical, emotional, or psychological**, and can include:

* Reduced sexual desire (libido)
* Difficulty with arousal or orgasm
* Pain during sex (especially in women after menopause)
* Movement-related challenges during sexual activity
* Hypersexuality (increased sexual desire or behavior, sometimes caused by certain medications like dopamine agonists)

---

## **Causes**

Sexual difficulties may arise from:

1. **Normal aging**

   * Reduced lubrication in women post-menopause
   * Erectile difficulties in men

2. **Medical conditions**

   * Diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, pelvic problems

3. **Parkinson’s effects**

   * Slowed or uncoordinated movements
   * Fatigue or tiredness
   * Bladder/bowel problems
   * Psychological impacts (stress, depression, reduced confidence)
   * Medication side effects

---

## **When to Seek Help**

* Persistent or worsening sexual problems
* Out-of-character hypersexuality (urgent consultation with your Parkinson’s specialist)
* Emotional or relationship distress due to sexual changes

---

## **Self-Help Strategies**

**Movement-related issues:**

# Sexual Function in Parkinson’s

Sexual problems can happen with Parkinson’s, but not everyone will experience these. Some people notice changes physically or emotionally, or with sexual drive.

Many people do not feel comfortable talking about sex, meaning sexual problems may be missed and not addressed.

## What Might Be Causing It?

At times, it is completely normal to have issues with sex. Different factors can influence it, including tiredness and mood. Normal ageing also causes physical changes that affect the ability to have or enjoy sex.  

- **Women after menopause:** Lower oestrogen levels can cause less lubrication and sometimes vaginal sensitivity or inflammation, making sex painful.  
- **Health conditions & medicines:** Pain from arthritis, pelvic problems, diabetes, heart disease, smoking, excess alcohol, and some medications can affect sexual function.

### Parkinson’s-Specific Factors

- **Movement problems:** Slowed movements or difficulty coordinating movements  
- **Fatigue:** Can lower sex drive (libido)  
- **Bladder or bowel problems:** May make you or your partner nervous about sex  
- **Medication:** Some medicines (e.g., antidepressants) can impact sexual desire, arousal, and ability to orgasm  
- **Reduced sex drive:** Can result from psychological and emotional effects of managing Parkinson’s, tiredness, or depression  
- **Reduced arousal & orgasm:** Parkinson’s can affect sexual function  
- **Confidence issues**

**Note:** Some Parkinson’s medicines (dopamine agonists) can cause hypersexuality—a marked increase in sexual thoughts, arousal, and behaviour. See the Impulsive Behaviours page for more information.

## What Should I Do About It?

- Some sexual function issues are normal and may improve on their own.  
- If problems persist, you can try strategies to help yourself or speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. Conversations are private and confidential, and medication changes may help.
