Freezing is a sudden feeling that you can’t start or complete a movement. Most people have "freezing of gait" meaning freezing happens when walking. People describe feeling their feet are glued to the ground and unable to move, but they’re still able to move their arms. It can happen at the start of a movement or in the middle of a movement (e.g. when you are starting to walk or in the middle of walking). Sometimes freezing can happen while eating, writing, or when you are rushing to do something. It is important to address freezing because it can impact on confidence and can contribute to falls.

## What might be causing it?

Freezing is a symptom of Parkinson’s. It often occurs in people who have had the condition for a long time, but it can also occur earlier on. Freezing happens more commonly in "off" (when medications are not working as well) but can also occur in "on" stages.

Factors that can make freezing more likely are:

- Being in crowded or narrow spaces (e.g. doorways)
- Distractions
- Feeling stressed

## What should I do about it?

There are things you can try for yourself but there are some situations where you should seek professional help. These include falling a lot or continuing to struggle with usual activities after trying the self-help strategies. It is best to seek help from your specialist Parkinson’s team or a physiotherapist (which may be through your GP).

The best thing to do if you think you can feel yourself freezing is to stop moving and hold on to your balance. Freezing can be a frightening feeling, but if you try to keep moving or become agitated you may fall.


There are different techniques that you can try. Some aim to overcome freezing when it happens, others aim to prevent it. You may find some work for you and others don’t. It is good to try out different strategies and see which suits you best. You might even find your own way to apply the principles.

The broad principles are:
a) **Attention & Thinking**

- Focus on what you are doing
- Thinking ahead or visualising
  b) **Using Weight**
- ‘Weight shifting’ to free up part of the body
- Marching
  c) **'Cueing'** This is using a ‘cue’ to keep movement flowing. Different cues can be tried:
- Visual cues
- Sounds
- Imagine cues

### Attention & Thinking

- Focus in on what you are trying to do.
- Think about putting your heel down first when taking each step.
- Think about _big_ steps.

_Plan method_

Reducing distractions may make this easier.

_'Visualisation'_

- Athletes and musicians use this to visualize their tasks before performing.
- Imagine the movements for the whole task before starting it. Think about it step by step.
- _For example, imagine the steps you need to do to get out of bed over and over until you feel confident in each step._

### Using Weight

Or rock your head and shoulders side to side to shift weight.

Marching prevent freezing:

- Gives rhythm to walking.
- Encourages big steps.
- As you go through narrow spaces, try exaggerating the march even more.
- As you turn, use big purposeful steps like a march, rather than pivoting.

### Cueing

These can be used both to prevent and overcome freezing.
a) _Visual cues_, for example:

- Ask someone to place their foot in front of yours for you to carefully step over. A rolled-up newspaper or handle of an umbrella work as well, just be careful not to trip on it.
- Use a laser to create a beam of light to follow.
- _Prevention_: Stick bold tape to the floor in spots you commonly experience freezing. You could use a fan shape around corners and between rooms.
- Some equipment has been designed with lasers built in, for example walking sticks or frames.

b) _Sound cues_, for example:

- Use a metronome app or device.
- Count out loud or to yourself.
- Sing a rhythmic song or rhyme.
- Listen to music with a good beat.
- _Prevention_: count or sing as you go through doorways or other spots that trigger you to freeze. Use the momentum of the rhythm to carry you through.

c) Imagine a cue, for example:

- Imagine a sound (i.e. a beat, metronome or rhythmic music).
- Imagine a line in front of you to step over.

_Tip: Think about your environment:_
_- Remove rugs or mats that cause you to freeze in your home._
_- Remove clutter that makes spaces feel small._

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I’ve got some tricks up my sleeve now. Well, I did a very good CBT course and mindfulness, and I use a variety of techniques to unfreeze myself. I use counting for its cueing. I think to myself, I’m going to move on four; I’m going to count one, two, three and four, which is the cha-cha rhythm: one, two, three, cha-cha-cha…[then move forward]. Or you could target; you pick a spot the other side of what is your barrier, and you step onto that, a particular pattern in the carpet.”
>
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “Sometimes she will freeze, and then if there’s a division, like from the carpet onto that mat, or tiles on the floor, then to get her to step over, tell her to step over that division. Sometimes I’ve told her to step over something that isn’t there, but just to get the idea of moving.”

> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson's)_

## Further assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- How much the freezing occurs and when this happens. This is to see if there is a relationship to medication (e.g. If it only occurs during “off” periods or when both “on” and “off”) or if there are any triggers.

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- For 3-5 days you could monitor your “on” and “off” times, freezing episodes, and when you take your medication. This will help to identify patterns in your freezing.

## Further treatments

A healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment.

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- If freezing happens during “off” periods they may adjust your antiparkinsonian medication.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) may also help freezing if it is related to off periods.

### Referral

- You may be referred to another service. Please be aware there is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you.
- You may be referred to **physiotherapy** and/or **occupational therapy** who can teach you strategies for dealing with freezing. They can also support you to adapt your daily activities or environment to manage the symptom better.

Research is ongoing to look for new ways of managing freezing, including the use of new technologies.

## Key messages

- Try out different self-help strategies for freezing to see what suits you. A physiotherapist or occupational therapist can help to teach you these.
- Freezing may be linked to “on”/ “off” times and may respond to Parkinson’s medication.
- Freezing can cause falls and injuries. It is important to let your GP, specialist nurse, or neurologist know if you are freezing during tasks such as walking and eating.
