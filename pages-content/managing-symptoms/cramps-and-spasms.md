# Cramps & Spasms (Dystonia)

Dystonia is an involuntary muscle contraction (this is different to Dyskinesia which refers to involuntary movements).  
Dystonia is caused by incorrect brain signals. Muscles become tighter or shorter than usual, making them stiff.  
Dystonia can involve twisting movements or spasms. Dystonia can feel painful or uncomfortable. Not everyone who has Parkinson‚Äôs will experience it.

Dystonia most commonly affects the legs and feet of someone with Parkinson‚Äôs. It can cause abnormal postures of limbs or digits.  
People may notice their toes curling. They may notice their feet turning in at the ankle. They may feel or see their big toe sticking up.  

Dystonia can also impact the eyelids, causing frequent blinking and an intolerance to light.  
It can affect the head and neck, the vocal cords, and/or the hands.

## What might be causing it?

Most people with Parkinson‚Äôs who experience dystonia have **secondary dystonia**.  
This means they get it as a symptom of their condition or as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medication.  

**Primary dystonia** is a genetic condition in people without Parkinson‚Äôs. This runs in families.

Some people with Parkinson‚Äôs notice dystonia when their medication levels are low.  
This may be:
- At the end of the day, or in between doses  
- Early in the morning before they have taken any medications  

They may have dystonia when their medication levels are at the highest in their bodies, but this is less common.

## What should I do about it?

There are various strategies you can try for yourself discussed below.  
You should also routinely talk to your Parkinson‚Äôs specialist team about these symptoms.  

They may be able to make medication adjustments to help.  
If the symptoms are causing difficulties with daily life or sleep then you may need to speak to the team sooner.

## What can I try for myself?

- Some people find pressure, warm compresses or stretching help  
- Some people discover *‚Äòsensory tricks‚Äô*. This is touching the affected area or a nearby area of the body. It can reduce the length or severity of the contraction  
- Relaxing techniques like a warm bath, yoga, or massage may help  
- **Eyelid dystonia (blepharospasm)** may respond to: pressure on the eyebrows, lying down, or chewing  

### Stretching
- It is best to be guided by your physiotherapist about specific stretches  
- Stretching should feel like a gentle pull on the muscle, not be painful  
- If you experience pain, speak to your physiotherapist, GP or Parkinson‚Äôs specialist team  
- Work through the different parts of the body, paying attention to where you get cramps or spasms  
- Hold each stretch for 10‚Äì30 seconds, keeping it still and steady  
- Breathe slowly in and out during the stretch ‚Äî don‚Äôt hold your breath  
- Repeat each stretch 3‚Äì4 times, with a brief break between  
- Try to make this a routine part of your life, several times per week

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson‚Äôs describe their experiences:

> ‚ÄúSometimes I do, I know when the muscles and everything get stiffer, and what I do, I just massage myself.‚Äù  
> *(Person with Parkinson‚Äôs)*

## Further Assessment

### Questions
Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions.  
You could think about these in advance and record them in your *‚ÄúMy Health‚Äù* section to bring to the appointment.

Things they might ask:
- Describe what you experience  
- When does it happen?  
- Is the problem affected by your Parkinson‚Äôs medication?  
- How does it impact on your daily activities or sleep?  
- Does anything help it / make it worse?  

### Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
- This can help you recall details and help professionals identify patterns  
- It may influence medication adjustments  
- Bring your record to your specialist appointment  

Record:
- When the dystonia happens  
- Whether you are *‚Äòon‚Äô* or *‚Äòoff‚Äô* when you experience dystonia  
- When you have taken your medication  

Usually 3‚Äì5 days of tracking will be enough to see patterns.

## Tests

Tests are rarely required for dystonia.

## Further Treatments

### Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson‚Äôs Specialist Nurses) may change your medication  
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional first  
- Changing treatment to manage dystonia may be needed ‚Äî this will generally be advised by your Parkinson‚Äôs Specialist team  

Possible adjustments:
- Longer-acting medications  
- Adjusting medication schedule to smaller, more frequent doses  
- Dissolving medications that have a quicker *‚Äòon‚Äô* effect ‚Äî this can help in the morning if dystonia is most difficult then  
- Non-Parkinson‚Äôs medications may also be considered  

### Referral
- You may be referred on to another service ‚Äî please be aware there is usually a waiting time  
- You may be referred to a physiotherapist to address movement problems more broadly  
- Sometimes people with severe cramps or spasms are referred to a specialist team for more invasive treatments  

Options may include:
- **Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections** ‚Äî to relax muscle groups that are moving excessively  
- **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)** ‚Äî may also be an option for some patients (see *Advanced & Surgical Treatments* for more information)  

# Key Messages

- Cramps or spasms, known as dystonia, are experienced by some people with Parkinson‚Äôs.  
- Medical treatment depends on when they happen, so keeping a diary can be helpful.
