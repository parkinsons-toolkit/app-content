# Parkinson's Toolkit - Content Repository

This repository contains the content files for the **Parkinson's Toolkit app** - a web application designed to provide evidence-based information and support for people living with Parkinson's disease, their families, and caregivers.

## Content Management

**Easy Updates**: Content maintainers can edit the markdown files in `./pages-content` in this repository. Changes are automatically reflected in the web application without requiring redeployments.

**Separation of Concerns**:

- **Text content** lives here as markdown files
- **Images** are stored in the web app repository and positioned via CSS
- **Navigation structure** is defined in `navigation.json`

### Security Guidelines for Content Contributors

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This repository supports HTML within markdown to enable rich content (videos, styled elements). Please follow these security guidelines:

**‚úÖ SAFE PRACTICES:**

- Use standard markdown syntax for text, headers, lists, and links
- Embed YouTube videos using provided HTML templates
- Add images using standard markdown image syntax

**‚ùå NEVER ADD:**

- `<script>` tags or JavaScript code
- Event handlers (`onclick`, `onload`, `onmouseover`, etc.)
- Form elements (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<button>` with actions)
- External iframes from non-approved domains
- Suspicious or unfamiliar HTML code from external sources

**üîç REVIEW PROCESS:**

- All content changes require pull request review
- Reviewers should check for suspicious HTML elements
- When in doubt, ask the development team about HTML additions
- Test content locally when possible before submitting

**üìã APPROVED HTML ELEMENTS:**

- `<div class="video-container">` for YouTube embeds
- `<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/...">` for approved videos
- `<img>` tags with GitHub raw URLs for images
- Basic styling divs with approved CSS classes

If you need to add new HTML elements or are unsure about content safety, please consult with the development team first.
