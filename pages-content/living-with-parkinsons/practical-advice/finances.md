# Finances

Having Parkinson’s, or caring for someone who does, can impact on your finances. For example, you may need to reduce your hours at work or pay for cleaners or special equipment in the home. Managing financially may become more difficult as the condition progresses. There is some help available so it can help to know what you might be entitled to.

## Paying Bills and Budgeting

Some symptoms of Parkinson’s may affect how you manage your money. They might include:

- Difficulties signing documents due to, for example, tremor
- Mobility problems may prevent you being able to go to the bank or cashpoint
- Speech problems may make paying by phone challenging
- Memory and thinking problems may make it difficult to do calculations or planning for payments
- You may miss bill payments due to being in hospital

### Hints & Tips for managing finances

If you are struggling to manage your finances, you may find these suggestions helpful:

- Manage any debts – this is important as they may get worse – talk to a helpful service such as <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizens Advice</a> or <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StepChange</a>.
- Try to save regularly, setting up monthly payments into a savings account. Whenever you have a pay or pension increase, try to increase the amount you save; but don’t skimp on things like heating or food.
- To work out how much you can save, keep a note of all spending for a month. You can then set a budget that covers the essentials and see how much is left to put into savings. If you have access to the internet you can set up online bank accounts to make payments and manage finances. This would reduce the need to visit the bank or speak over the phone. Online accounts require passwords in order to access them. If you have difficultly remembering passwords, think about ways of storing password information securely (e.g. through a password management app on your mobile phone).
- If you have difficulty writing your signature on bank documents, a facsimile signature stamp may be useful. This can be used to create a legal signature with a rubber stamp meaning you no longer need to physically write your signature. Most companies will require a copy of your signature which will then be used this to customise your portable stamp. You can buy these online (e.g., from Amazon).
- Symptoms such as tremor may make it difficult for you to retrieve your credit/debit cards from your purse or wallet. If this is the case, it might be helpful to use an automatic pop-up card wallet. These wallets have a small lever (usually at the bottom) which slides your cards out in order without them falling out, making them easily accessible.
- Consider appointing a Finance and Property Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).
  - This would allow your chosen person(s) to deal with financial matters if you are not able to make decisions for yourself. This includes paying bills, deciding how to spend your money, collecting pensions, and managing bank or building society accounts.
  - It’s important to apply for LPA while you still have mental capacity (you’re able to make decisions). If you lose decision-making capacity before having an LPA in place, someone will have to apply to the Court of Protection to manage your money. This can be a slow and expensive process.
  - See our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">_Legal Matters_</a> page for more information about the different types of LPA and how to set these up.

## Government Benefits

There are a number of benefits you may be entitled to. These can help with extra costs of living with Parkinson’s.

This section outlines the financial support available to people living with Parkinson’s, carers, and other sources of assistance they may be entitled to.

If you find these complicated don’t worry, there are several sources of help available – see the bottom of this page for more details and links to these sources.

### For People with Parkinson’s:

_**Attendance Allowance**_
Attendance Allowance helps those who are State Pension age or older with extra costs of living with an illness or disability. It is paid to the person who requires support with their personal care or safety (not to a carer). There are two payment rates and how much you receive depends on the level of support you need – not on the help you are already receiving.

This is a **non means-tested** benefit; the amount awarded is not dependent on your income or savings.

To be eligible to claim, you must:

- Be State Pension age or older (you can check the State Pension age using the government online calculator)
- Have had care or supervision needs for the last 6 months
- Have been living in the UK for 2 of the last 3 years and your immigration status does not prevent you claiming
- Be living in the UK
- Be terminally ill or have a severe physical and/or mental disability and require care or supervision

**Personal Independence Payment (PIP)**
PIP can help those who are below State Pension age with some of the extra costs of living with a long-term illness or disability. It is paid to the person who requires support with day-to-day activities, and you do not need to be already receiving care or supervision at the time of applying.

PIP is not taxable and you don’t need to have paid National Insurance contributions to qualify. You do not have to be in employment and the amount granted is not means-tested.

To be eligible to claim, you must:

- Be between the ages of 16 and State Pension age (you can check the State Pension age using the government online calculator)
  - You will be able to stay on PIP if you claimed it for the first time before you reached State Pension age. If you are State Pension age or above at the time of applying, you may be able to claim Attendance Allowance instead (see above)
- Have been present in the UK for 2 out of the last 3 years before claiming. This time condition does not apply if you are terminally ill.
- Be living in the UK, Channel Island, Republic of Ireland, or Isle of Man. You must not be prevented from claiming by your immigration status.
- Meet the disability conditions (concerning your daily living and mobility needs) which are looked at during a PIP assessment. You must have met the disability conditions for at least 3 months before eligibility for PIP and be likely to continue to meet the disability conditions for a period of 9 months. These time conditions do not apply if you are terminally ill.

**Disability Living Allowance (DLA)**
DLA has been replaced by PIP for those between the ages of 16 and State Pension age. You can now only apply for DLA if you’re under the age of 16.

If you already receive DLA:

- If you were born on or before 8 April 1948, you’ll continue to receive DLA as long as you’re eligible for it.
- If you were born after 8 April 1948, your DLA will end. You’ll receive a letter telling you when that will happen. You’ll continue to receive DLA until that date. Unless your circumstances change, you do not need to do anything until you get this letter.

DLA is now aimed at children between the ages of 0 to 16 and looks for care and mobility problems which exceed the care and mobility needs of a child of the same age. This is a **non means-tested** benefit; the amount awarded is not dependent on your income or savings.

---

### For Carers:

**Carer’s Allowance**
Carer’s Allowance helps those who regularly spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone. The carer does not need to be related to the person they're caring for or be living with them.

Carer’s Allowance is not intended to be a payment for the services of caring and the carer does not get paid extra if they care for more than one person.

By claiming Carer’s Allowance, it can affect other benefits that both themselves and the person they care for may be receiving. Use the government online benefits calculator to work out how claiming Carer’s Allowance might impact other benefits.

This is a **non means-tested** benefit; the amount awarded is not dependent on their income or savings.

To be eligible to claim, the person they are caring for must already be receiving one of the following benefits:

- Attendance Allowance
- Personal Independence Payment (PIP) – daily living component (either rate)
- Disability Living Allowance – the middle or highest care rate
- Constant Attendance Allowance at or above the normal maximum rate with an Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit
- Constant Attendance Allowance at the basic (full day) rate with a War Disablement Pension
- Armed Forces Independence Payment

The carer must also:

- Be 16 years or older at the time of claiming
- Spend at least 35 hours a week caring for someone
- Have been living in England, Scotland or Wales for 2 of the last 3 years and your immigration status does not prevent you from claiming
- Be living in the UK
- Not be enrolled in full-time education (you are not studying for 21 hours or more a week)
- Earn £123 or less a week after tax, national insurance, and expenses

**Carer’s Credit**
If the carer is unable to pay National Insurance contributions (for example, because they are unable to work while caring for someone), Carer’s Credit will help to protect their State Pension and other benefits that depend on their National Insurance record. This means they will not directly receive money for Carer’s Credit.

To be eligible to claim, carers must:

- Be caring for someone for at least 20 hours a week
- Not be entitled to Carer’s Allowance.

### Universal Credit

Universal Credit is a **means-tested** benefit to cover basic living expenses for those out of work or receiving a low income. Extra money may be given to carers and people unable to work due to having a disability or health condition, such as Parkinson’s.

Universal Credit replaces the following six existing benefits with a single payment:

- Housing Benefit
- Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (see below)
- Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance (see below)
- Income Support
- Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit

Since 2019, new claimants for a working-age means-tested benefit will need to apply for Universal Credit rather than the older benefits listed above.

To be eligible to claim, you must:

- Be between the ages of 18 and State Pension age (you can check the State Pension age using the government online calculator)
- Have a low income and capital of £16,000 or less
- Be living and have a ‘right to reside’ in the UK
- Not be in education (unless you’re claiming a disability benefit)
- Have accepted a claimant commitment.

**Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)**
Employment and Support Allowance can help if you’re not able to work as much due to a disability or health condition.

ESA is made up of two parts – contributory ESA and income-related ESA:

- Income-related ESA: _This has been replaced by Universal Credit_.
- Contributory ESA: This has now been replaced by ‘New Style ESA’ for new claimants. To be able to claim, you must have paid enough National Insurance contributions in specific tax years (National Insurance credits count). Payment of contributory ESA is often limited to 12 months.

This is a **non means-tested** benefit; the amount awarded is not dependent on your income or savings.

To be eligible to claim, you must:

- Not be working (although some limited work is permitted)
- Have a limited capability for work – this is determined by a medical assessment called a ‘Work Capability Assessment’
- Be between the ages of 16 and State Pension age (you can check the State Pension age using the government online calculator)
- Be living in the UK
- Not be entitled to Income Support, Jobseeker’s Allowance, or Statutory Sick Pay (SSP).

**Jobseeker’s Allowance**
Jobseeker’s Allowance aims to help people who do not have a job or are working less than 16 hours a week. They must also be searching for employment.

There are two forms of Jobseeker’s Allowance:

- Income-based: _This has been replaced by Universal Credit_.
- Contribution-based: Can be paid for up to 6 months, either in one period or several shorter periods. It is **not means-tested** but may be affected by part-time earnings or a workplace or personal pension.

To be eligible to claim, you must:

- Be unemployed or working fewer than 16 hours a week
- Be under State Pension age
- Be available and actively seeking work
- Live in the UK.

**Statutory Sick Pay (SSP)**
You can receive SSP if you are employed but not able to work because of a health condition, such as Parkinson’s. It’s paid by your employer for up to 28 weeks.

If you regularly have time off work due to sickness, these periods may count as ‘linked’. To be linked, sickness periods must:

- Last 4 or more days each
- Occur 8 weeks or less apart from each other
  You will no longer be able to claim SSP if you have a continuous series of linked periods that lasts more than 3 years.

SSP is taxable and National Insurance contributions may be deducted.

To be eligible to claim, you must:

- Be employed to work full- or part-time
- Earn at least £118 a week (before tax)
- Have been ill for at least 4 consecutive days (including non-working days)
- T✓ Tell your employer that you’re sick before their deadline or within 7 days of sickness. If you are off sick for more than 7 consecutive days you will need to provide a ‘fit note’ (also called a doctor’s certificate or ‘sick’ note). Your GP or hospital doctor will be able to issue you a fit note.

If you are off sick for more than 7 consecutive days you will need to provide a ‘fit note’ (also called a doctor’s certificate or ‘sick’ note). Your GP or hospital doctor will be able to issue you a fit note.

</iframe>
</div>

If you have a disability or long-term health condition, you should not be charged VAT on products designed or adapted for your own personal or domestic use. This includes:

- Stair lifts, adjustable beds, wheelchairs, alarms, and building work (e.g. building ramps)
- Installation, repairs, maintenance, or spare parts for equipment

You can apply for VAT relief by:

- Asking your supplier for a VAT relief form
- Applying online when purchasing VAT-free items online
- Downloading a form to take into a shop when you make a qualifying purchase
- Visit <a href="http://www.gov.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a> and search _“VAT relief”_ or call HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) on **0300 200 3700**

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “When we go to the mobility shop to buy things like walking sticks and wheelchairs, he doesn’t charge us VAT because \[partner] has Parkinson’s.”
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

---

## Prescription Charges/Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC)

### Medical exemption

People with Parkinson’s often need to pay multiple prescription charges. This is because of the number of medications prescribed for the management of motor and non-motor symptoms, and this number increases as the condition progresses.

You can get free prescriptions if you or your partner receive any of the following, or if you’re under the age of 20 and the dependant of someone receiving any of the following:

- Universal Credit
- Income-related Employment and Support Allowance (ESA)
- Income Support
- Income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance
- Pension Credit

If you are age 60 or over, you are entitled to free prescriptions. If you have a long-term physical disability that prevents you from leaving home without help from someone else, you can also get free prescriptions regardless of age. You can apply for medical exemption via the FP92A application form, which you can get from your doctor, pharmacist, or hospital.

To check if you’re entitled to free NHS prescriptions and help with other NHS costs, you can use the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/check-if-youre-eligible-help" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online NHS eligibility checker</a>.

### What help is there if I don’t qualify for free prescriptions?

The charity ‘Citizens Advice’ may be able to direct you to support that you can access for free. Also, your GP surgery may have a social prescribing link worker who can direct you to support and resources in your local area.

Other things to consider are listed below:

**The NHS Low Income Scheme**
This scheme is run by the NHS Business Services Authority. It aims to help with health costs for people who aren’t exempt from health service charges but are on a low income.

You can receive full (HC2 certificate) or partial (HC3 certificate) help with all NHS charges, depending on your income and circumstances.

How to apply for the NHS Low Income Scheme:

- You will need to complete an HC1 application form, which you can get online or from NHS hospitals, dentists, opticians, and Jobcentres.
- You can also call **0345 603 1108** and select the option for ‘health publications’ to get a copy sent to you with a pre-paid return envelope.
- For further guidance on how to apply, visit the <a href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/dont-get-caught-out-penalty-charges/check-you-tick" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Business Services Authority</a> website.

**Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC)**
If you do not qualify for free prescriptions and need prescription items regularly, you could save money with a Prescription Prepayment Certificate (PPC). A PPC enables you to get as many NHS prescriptions as you need for a set price.

<ins>Ways you can buy a PPC:</ins>

- Online – visit the <a href="https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/buy-prescription-prepayment-certificate/start" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Business Services Authority</a> website (this is recommended as the quickest way).

## Help with Travel Costs

If you are referred for health service treatment at an NHS hospital or similar place, you may be able to claim a refund of reasonable travel costs under the Healthcare Travel Costs Scheme (HTCS). This may also cover the travel costs of an extra person if you need someone with you.

You should use the cheapest, most appropriate means of transport, which in most cases will be public transport. You may be able to claim the cost of a taxi fare or cost of car fuel, but this must be agreed with the hospital beforehand.

To qualify for help under this scheme, you must meet the following criteria:

1. At the time of the appointment, you or your partner **must receive qualifying benefits or allowances listed on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS website</a>, or meet the eligibility criteria for the NHS Low Income Scheme (HC2 certificate)**. If you have a HC3 certificate under the Low Income Scheme then you may be entitled to a partial refund of travel costs.
2. You must have a **referral from a healthcare professional** to a specialist or a hospital for NHS treatment or tests.
3. **Your appointment must be on a separate visit** to when the referral was made.

## Costs of Equipment, Housing & Care

### Equipment

Funding for equipment depends on the type of equipment you need and what funding is available in your local area or from other funding sources.

Some local British Red Cross groups can loan out equipment, including wheelchairs. They may deliver and collect the equipment for you at an extra charge if you can’t travel to your local store.

<div class="video-container">
<iframe 
  width="560" 
  height="315" 
  src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6mpOB0xTnx4" 
  title="YouTube video player" 
  allowfullscreen>
</iframe>
</div>

### Home Adaptations

Occupational therapists may be able to help you to arrange funding for minor home adaptations (e.g. fitting grab rails and handrails by stairs). For advice on more expensive home adaptations (e.g. stair lifts, accessible showers), discuss with occupational therapists in local authority social services (or adult services) or health and social care services.

If you need major changes to your home (e.g. an extension, fixed hoists), you may be able to claim a disabled facilities grant. For this, an occupational therapist will assess your needs and contact the relevant local authority departments about the necessary changes. Funding for major home adaptations is often means-tested. This means the amount of funding you receive depends on how much money you have, including any savings.

To read more about the Disabled Facilities Grant, visit <a href="https://www.gov.uk/disabled-facilities-grants" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a>. For more information on equipment and home adaptations, see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page.

### Care Services

As Parkinson’s progresses, you might find you need extra support to carry out day-to-day tasks including personal care – help with washing, going to the toilet, meals and getting dressed. You may decide that you would benefit from receiving care in your own home to help you better manage your condition. This type of help is generally called social care.

If you would like to have social care support in your own home, your local authority social services (adult services) or social work department will carry out a needs or care assessment. This assessment is free of charge. But there is a threshold for getting social care from the local authority. Even if you are eligible for social care from your local authority, it still will ask you about your finances; in other words, it is means tested. But many hundreds of thousands of people get help from their local authority and you should not be put off by these assessments. If you are eligible then there are various options about the type of support, you will be offered – and this will be decided with you and put into a care plan. Some people choose to manage the money for social care themselves (as a Direct Payment); others take it as a personal budget and get care from a particular care agency or combine home care with going to a day centre, for example.

---

## Continuing Healthcare Funding

NHS continuing healthcare (CHC) is a package of health and social care arranged and funded by the NHS. It is free. It aims to help people who have severe ongoing care needs related to their health.

This funding is **not means-tested** and can cover care received in a care home or in your own home.

To be eligible, you must:

- Be aged 18 or over
- Have care needs that are primarily ‘healthcare needs’ and beyond the scope of local authority social care services
  > A diagnosis of Parkinson’s does **not** guarantee CHC funding.

There is no application form for CHC. Instead, professionals carry out an assessment to determine your care needs. If granted, the funding will be reviewed every 3 months as it is not given on a permanent basis.

For more information about CHC, see the public information leaflet (linked in our More Information section) provided by the Department of Health and Social Care. You may like to seek help with whether you might be eligible from national helping agencies (see list below) or Citizens Advice.
