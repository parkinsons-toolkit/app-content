# Reading, Writing and Technology

Reading, writing, and using technology may be more difficult for people with Parkinson’s. This can be due to a combination of factors, and we will explore each issue in detail below.

---

## Reading

### Why can it be difficult with Parkinson’s?

Eye movements involved in reading are highly complex and must be coordinated in order to track words on a page.

- **Saccadic eye movements** are the rapid eye movements that allow the eyes to quickly jump to a new target. These are important for the eyes to jump to a new line on the page. In Parkinson’s, these movements can be slow, and it can be hard to find the right spot on the next line to continue reading. These eye movements can also become fast if you are experiencing dyskinesias.
- **Vergence eye movements** are the eye movements needed for seeing an object up close or far away. These eye movements are important when focusing on a near task, like reading. In Parkinson’s, vergence eye movement can be impaired resulting in the person experiencing double vision.
- Other eye problems that can make reading difficult include:
  - Slowing of eye lid movement. This means less blinking which can cause dry or irritated eyes or even blurring of vision.
  - Spasms of the eyelid muscles can cause involuntary eye closure, called _blepharospasm_.
  - Some medications used in Parkinson’s can cause dry eyes.

### What can I try for myself?

For dry eyes, over-the-counter ointments and eye drops are available from pharmacists; they can be very helpful.

### What else may be helpful?

Have regular eye checks to see if there are problems with near vision as this tends to deteriorate as people age. If a regular eye check is normal or new glasses are prescribed and you are still having problems reading, you may wish to ask your GP, optometrist, or ophthalmologist for a referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist. A neuro-ophthalmologist can do further tests and may prescribe ‘prisms’ (a special kind of glasses).

See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/five-senses" class="internal-link">_5 Senses_</a> page for more information on visual changes in Parkinson’s.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/writing.jpg" alt="writing" class="example-class">


You may find writing more difficult if you experience:

- Slower movement of hands
- Increased stiffness in the hands
- Decreased dexterity in hands - harder to grip and move a pen or pencil
- Decreased stamina for writing
- Tremor

### What can I try for myself?

- Trial a fibre-tip or gel ink pen as these flow most easily
- Use a pen grip, wide pen, or a pen with a built-in grip to provide a more comfortable and relaxed grip on the pen
- To improve the size of your writing, you could try:
  - Using lined paper, or darkly lined paper underneath light paper in order to guide writing o Aiming for the above page line with each upward pen stroke while forming letters o Concentrating on ‘big and slow’ or ‘smooth and slow’ may help with small or feathery writing
  - Practising hand exercises. At the bottom of this page you can find a link to a YouTube video of hand exercises you can try.

### Hand exercises:

1.<ins>First Exercise</ins>

- Put your hands straight out in front of you, shoulder-height, with your palms away from you and fingers extended wide.
- Turn your hands towards your face, and pull them back to be even with your body at your ribs, making a tight fist with your hands at the same time.
- Make a fist as you bring your hand in and extending your palm as you extend your hands out.
  Repeat this 20 times.

  2.<ins>Second Exercise</ins>

- Tap each finger on your right hand to your right thumb and then extend upwards. Do the same on your left hand at the same time.
- _Explained in detail:_ Tap right pointer finger to your right thumb and your left pointer finger to your left thumb, then extend both pointer fingers to the sky; then tap middle fingers to each thumb, and extend each middle finger to the sky, etc.
- Repeat this exercise twice on each finger.

  3.<ins>Third Exercise</ins>

- Curl fingers down so that the nail area of fingers are touching where the base of the fingers connect to the palm of the hand.
- Then extend fingers up and out as wide as they can go.
- Curl and extend 20 times – include your thumb in the curling and extending.

### What else may be helpful?

If your handwriting does not improve despite trying the above suggestions, you could try seeking the advice of an occupational therapist. An occupational therapist can give you more specific hand exercises that may help with writing and other specialised hand tasks. For a referral for occupational therapy, speak to your GP.

You can also consider:

- If you have difficulty writing your signature on documents (prescriptions, passports, banking, etc.), a facsimile signature stamp may be useful. This can be used to create a legal signature with a rubber stamp meaning the person no longer needs to physically write their signature.
- Alternative ways of communicating (e.g. using a computer).

## Using Technology - Computers

If you struggle to communicate by speaking or writing, you could consider using equipment that may reduce these challenges - like a computer or tablet. But, you may find it challenging to use these if you have a lot of tremor or stiffness.

### What can I try for myself?

- If you use a laptop and find typing on a standard keyboard difficult, try typing on a touchscreen (e.g. tablet or mobile phone).
- Video call software can be easy to use with little typing needed. E.g. Zoom, Teams, Facetime, Google Meet.
- You can use talk-to-text software to send messages to friends or family. Talk-to-text means you push a button, talk, and the program takes your verbal words and records them as written words.
  This means you don’t have to type anything.

If using a computer or the internet feels overwhelming, there are training courses available (see More Information for contact details).

- **Age UK** may offer a computer training course near you.
- **Online Centres Network** is made up of many organisations, with the mission to provide access and advice on computers and the internet. They have 6,000 centres around the UK.
- You could ask at your **local library** to see if they offer computer training opportunities.

**Choosing a device:**  
| Device | Pros | Cons |
|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Tablet** | - Uses touchscreen control to select options to type <br> - Talk-to-text may be more readily available <br> - Lightweight and easily portable <br> - Likely has a camera for video calls | - May have limited software capability |
| **Laptop** | - Uses touch pad and possibly a mouse to select options <br> - Has a keyboard <br> - Likely has a camera for video calls | - Not as lightweight or as easily portable <br> - Might not have talk-to-text readily available |
| **Desktop Computer**| - Uses mouse to select options and keyboard for typing <br> - May have a camera for video calls | - Not portable or lightweight <br> - Might not have talk-to-text readily available |

## Using Technology - Mobile Phones

### Why can it be difficult for people with Parkinson’s?

- Decreased hand strength for holding a phone
- Tremor
- Softer voice may make it more difficult to be heard
- Decreased stamina for holding the phone

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/showing-phone.jpg" alt="phone" class="example-class">


### What can I try for myself?

- Hand exercises to increase strength and mobility may help with holding a phone.
  - See hand exercises in the above 'Writing' section.
  - An occupational therapist can provide more specific exercises to complete.
- Exercises to increase your voice volume or make your speech more clear may help you in conversations.
  - Speech therapists can identify what areas you could work on and give you exercises to practise at home. For a referral to a speech therapist, speak with your GP.
  - Voice Analyst: an application (app) for your mobile phone or tablet. It allows you to measure the volume and pitch of your voice. Can bring to speech therapist appointments to share your progress and results.
    - There is a fee to download this app.
    - See more information on 'Apps' on this page below.
  - Singing in a choir, practising singing in the shower, or holding a note long and loud may all be helpful – using your voice is important.

### What may be helpful about a mobile phone?

- Mobile phones can offer peace of mind. For example, knowing that you can contact someone straight away, no matter where they are.
- Smartphones (a mobile that acts as a small computer and connects with the internet) can have applications (‘apps’) downloaded onto it.

  - Apps are pieces of software that can be used to perform specific tasks.

    _Examples:_ writing a note, playing a game, or letting you know when your bus is coming.

  - Smartphones have many different features that could be useful, including the following:
    - Voice activation (either built-in on the phone or available as an app). This can allow you to: call someone in your phonebook by saying their name, search the internet, dictate text messages and emails, open apps, and record notes as reminders.
    - Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers: allow a nominated person (like a partner, family member or carer) to see on a map where you are. You need to be carrying your smartphone, and it needs to have service in order for this to work.
    - Video calling: lets you see and hear each other during a call o Medication manager apps: remind you when your medication is due. They may also let you store medical information.
    - Data gathering apps. These are used to measure some movement symptoms and speech. They may be used to inform the person who adjusts your Parkinson’s medications or treatments
