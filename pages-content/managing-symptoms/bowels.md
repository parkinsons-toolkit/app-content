# Bowel Symptoms

Everyone has a different natural bowel pattern, so bowel symptoms are different for each person. Constipation, or reduced bowel motions, is common in Parkinson’s. You may experience:

- Difficulty passing a bowel movement (straining)
- Hard or lumpy stools
- Opening bowels less often. If you are having less than 3 bowel movements per week, it is likely you are constipated.
- A feeling that you haven’t fully emptied your bowel.
- Feeling of blockage in the bottom or having to use fingers to remove stool during a bowel movement.

Constipation can make you feel very unwell and, if left untreated, can become serious. Constipation can affect the absorption of medications and, if severe, may cause vomiting. Both of these can make your medication less effective.

Constipation can sometimes lead to diarrhoea or leaking of stool. Hard stool gets stuck and only the liquid content comes out. So, although it can seem like diarrhoea, the bowels are very constipated and blocked up. This is known as “overflow diarrhoea” and the best approach to resolve it is to treat the constipation.

## What might be causing it?

In Parkinson’s, constipation is common due to slowing down of the bowel contractions. Diet, medications, and activity levels also have a big impact on the bowels and can cause constipation. Constipation can be a symptom of other medical conditions so a healthcare professional may ask questions to check for these.

## What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try for yourself, but there are some circumstances where you should seek professional help. If you are in severe pain or passing a lot of blood in the stools you should contact your GP to be seen urgently or go to A&E.

**See your GP if you have had any of the following:**

- Bleeding from the back passage
- Abdominal or anal pain
- Diarrhoea following a period of constipation (see above)
- Significant change in your bowel habit that lasts 4 weeks or more
- Unintentional significant weight loss (see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/weight" class="internal-link">_Weight_</a> page)
- New bowel incontinence
- If you have tried the suggestions listed below under _What can I try for myself?_ and the problem persists after a month

## What can I try for myself?

### Diet & hydration

Fibre in your diet helps improve constipation. Eat a variety of fibres.

**Fibre is in:**

- **Wholegrain** – many breakfast cereals, whole-wheat pasta, wholegrain bread and oats, barley and rye
- **Fruit**
- **Vegetables**
- **Peas**, **beans**, **pulses**, **nuts**, **seeds**

<ins>**How much fibre?**</ins> Aim for 30 g spread throughout the day. If you are not meeting this then gradually increase fibre intake to reach this. You can find more information about fibre content in food through the links listed at the bottom of this page.

Dehydration contributes to constipation, and fluids are needed to treat dehydration. But, if you are not dehydrated, then just drinking extra fluid will not resolve the constipation. Alcoholic drinks are not good for hydration, as they make you urinate more.

<ins>**How much fluid?**</ins> In general, 1.5-2L of fluid (8-10 cups or medium glasses) per day is advised. You will need more if it is hot or you are exerting more energy. People stop feeling thirsty before the body is completely rehydrated so you should drink even if you are not thirsty. You can also lose your sense of thirst a bit when you get older. The colour of urine is a good indicator of hydration; if you are drinking enough your urine should be a straw or pale-yellow colour.

**Tips on drinking enough:**  
_Tip 1: It is difficult to drink this much fluid for some people. You could try drinking a small glass of water each time you take your medication and a glass of water or a drink (e.g. cup of tea) with each meal. _

_Tip 2: All sorts of fluid count towards your daily amount, it doesn’t have to be just water. Fruit juices, squash, hot drinks (e.g. tea, coffee), milk and low alcohol beer all count. Remember you can also have fluid in your food which counts too, such as milk in cereal or soups._

**Caution: If you have been advised to limit your fluid intake for another health reason (e.g. heart or kidney disease), then speak to your healthcare professional first.**

Certain fruits help draw water into the bowel to soften the stool. Increasing intake of these helps constipation:

- Apples
- Apricots
- Avocado
- Kiwi fruit
- Peaches
- Pears
- Plums
- Prunes

### Activity

Being physically active improves the movement of the bowels. If you can, try going for a walk every day. See <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> for advice on how to achieve this.

### Toileting advice

- Getting into a routine helps.
- Allow adequate time.
- Position affects ease of bowel opening. Try raising your feet up on a stool when sat on a toilet as this can ease bowel opening. If possible, the best position is with your knees higher than your hips.
- Avoid resisting the urge to go to the toilet as this can cause constipation.
- _There is <ins>not</ins> suitable evidence to recommend “abdominal massage” as a technique for treating constipation._

### Over-the-counter medications

**Caution: If you have severe pain or known bowel disease (such as Crohn’s Disease or Ulcerative Colitis) then you should speak to your pharmacist, GP or specialist before taking these.**

#### Probiotics & prebiotics

Lots of bacteria live in your bowels as part of the normal gut environment, introduced through the food you eat. These supplements change the mix of bacteria in your bowel:

- Probiotics are living bacteria.
- Prebiotics are fibre that acts a bit like a fertilizer for the bacteria living in the bowel.

There is limited research in this area, complicated by the wide variety of strains available. There has been some research that showed a combination of pro- and prebiotics improved constipation in people with Parkinson’s.

#### Fibre supplements

If you have not got enough fibre in your diet, supplementation may be considered. The widely available fibre supplement is _psyllium husk_, or _ispaghula husk_ – the ingredient of the laxative _Fybogel_.

#### Laxatives

Many people with Parkinson’s need to take laxatives on a regular and long-term basis to keep the bowels opening regularly. Laxatives only work if you are adequately hydrated. Laxatives are available from chemists and come in different types:

- **Bulk-forming laxatives** contain fibre and increase the bulk of the stool. This, in turn, stimulates the bowel. They can take a few days to work. Example: _Fybogel_.
- **Osmotic laxatives** draw water into the bowel to soften the stool. They can take a few days to work. Examples: _Lactulose, Movicol, and Macrogol_.
- **Stool softener laxatives** encourage water into the stool to soften it. Examples: _sodium docusate_ and _arachis oil_.
- **Stimulant laxatives** stimulate the bowel to move the stool along. They take about 6–12 hours to work and can become less effective if used for a prolonged period of time. Examples: _senna (Senokot)_ and _bisacodyl (Dulcolax)_.

<ins>_Side effects of laxatives:_</ins> The most common side effects are bloating, cramping or nausea. These often settle or may be improved by taking a smaller amount of the laxative. Overuse of laxatives can cause dehydration.

<ins>_Which to choose?:_</ins> Research has shown that _Macrogol_ is likely to be effective in Parkinson’s and is safe. If one type of laxative is not effective, another type could be added in as well. Generally, osmotic or bulk-forming laxatives are advised first, while stimulant laxatives are a later choice.

#### Finding toilets

If finding toilets when out and about is a concern, the _National Key Scheme_ may help. This system allows people with a disability to unlock more than 9,000 accessible public toilets across the UK. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.disabilityrightsuk.org/radar-keys?srsltid=AfmBOophjHsd-3Hg87Sw7Q3ebdt_t7h-HI0iKErqzf9-Pxg46jZt8qaK" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_Disability Rights UK_</a> website. You can use this website to buy a ‘Radar Key’ and/or Radar Key Region List.

## Further assessment

If the suggested strategies are not working, then consult your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. You may wish to consider the following to help you to prepare for the appointment.

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- Full detail of your bowel pattern now and in the past
- Whether you have passed any blood or noticed a colour change of the stool
- Whether you have pain
- Whether you have unintentionally lost weight
- Whether you have nausea or vomiting
- Whether you have any urinary symptoms, such as having to urinate more often
- What your diet and lifestyle more broadly are like
- Whether your diet or activity levels have changed recently

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- Try to monitor constipation for about a week. The details that are helpful to record include:
  - Bowel movements. Detail can be helpful: small/medium/large, hard/soft/watery. The _Bristol Stool Chart_ is the chart used by professionals to describe the stool (see the useful links at the bottom of this page).
  - Your food and fluid intake.

### Tests

- Depending on their assessment, there is a small chance the healthcare professional will arrange further tests.
- This may include a stool sample, blood tests, a scan such as an X-Ray or CT scan, or an endoscopy. An endoscopy is where a camera is used to look inside the gut. It may be via the anus (known as a colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy) to look at the lower part of the gut.

### Further Treatments

A healthcare professional may be able to give more personalised advice about things you could try yourself.

#### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- **Please do not make changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- Some laxatives require a prescription.
- Some laxatives are given via the bottom, which can be tricky to do yourself, so may require a community nurse to come to the home to administer it. These are more likely in severe constipation or overflow diarrhoea.

**Some medications that may contribute to constipation:**

- Pain killers (e.g. codeine, morphine, gabapentin)
- Anticholinergic medications (e.g. atropine, trihexyphenidyl, oxybutynin, solifenacin)
- Some anti-sickness medications (e.g. ondansetron)
- Some medications used for pain or sleep (tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline)
- Some heart/blood pressure medications (calcium channel blockers, e.g. verapamil or beta blockers e.g. propranolol)
- Some antipsychotic medications (e.g. clozapine)
- Calcium or iron supplements
- Diuretic medications (e.g. furosemide)
- Some antacids
- Medications for diarrhoea (e.g. loperamide)
- Some medications for seizures (e.g. phenytoin, clonazepam)

### Referral

You may be referred on to another service for specialist input. Referrals for bowel problems would typically be to Gastroenterology or Colorectal Surgery.

## Key messages

- Stay hydrated and ensure you eat plenty of fibre.
- Stay active.
- Constipation can affect your Parkinson’s medications.
- Get on top of the problem early so it doesn’t get worse.
