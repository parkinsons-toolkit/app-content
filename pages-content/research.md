# Research

Research plays an important role in increasing our knowledge of human health and wellbeing. Taking part in research can be an empowering way to take a positive step towards understanding how best to treat or manage a health condition, such as Parkinson’s.

This section has 2 key parts:

1. Taking part in research – describes some reasons people choose to get involved in research and details of what this might entail.
2. Different type of research in Parkinson’s giving an overview of the range of research in Parkinson’s.

## Taking Part in Research

Depending on the type of study, by taking part in research you may be able to:

- Learn more about a condition that affects you or interests you
- Make a difference now and for future generations by helping to improve treatments and people’s quality of life
- Support research for a condition you care about
- Access new treatments
- Take an active role in your own care

### What types of research are there that you could take part in?

There are different types of research you can take part in. Research studies can range from testing new medical treatments or new devices, to carrying out interviews or surveys on a whole range of topics. This means there is a choice, making it easier for you to find the right study for you.

Research can take place in various locations, including hospitals, GP practices, and in participants’ homes. Studies are increasingly also conducted online or by telephone. The amount of time and activity needed to take part in a study can also vary. The study may need you to take part on only one occasion, or you may have to return for several visits over a longer time.

To help you decide if you would like to take part or not, the researchers will be able to tell you all about their study and what will be involved if you decide to take part.

### Who can get involved in research?

Researchers will often need both people with and without Parkinson’s to take part in studies. This is so that information about people with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s can be compared with those who do not have the condition.

Each study has guidelines about who can or cannot take part in the study. These guidelines are called eligibility criteria. These will vary between studies depending on what the research aims to do.

Researchers will explain their eligibility checklist before asking you to sign up to the study. This is to make sure it is suitable for you to take part.

### What does taking part involve?

Studies vary in their design depending on what the research is aiming to do.

Before taking part in a study, a researcher will make sure that you have been told all about the study. You will also have the chance to ask questions. You will then be asked to sign a consent form. This shows that anyone taking part in research
has completed informed consent, understands the purpose, benefits, and potential risks of taking part in the study, and has agreed to take part.

For a list of helpful questions you can ask researchers to help you better understand the study, see the <a href="https://bepartofresearch.nihr.ac.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Institute for Health Research's (NIHR) 'Be Part of Research'</a> site.

Although most research relies on volunteers, and people are not paid to take part, studies will often be able to cover your expenses (i.e. the cost of travelling to the place of research). The research can also sometimes take place in your own home, but this will depend on the type of study. The study team will be able to tell you how this will be managed for their study.

### Your rights as a research participant

Before anyone can take part in any research study they should have the chance to read information about the study. You should have the chance to ask any questions so that you understand what you will have to do.

The study information should also outline your rights as a participant and include the following information:

- Who is doing the research
- The purpose of the research
- Information about the study methods. This could include a study drug, a talking therapy, or a placebo. (A placebo is an inactive substance or treatment designed to have no therapeutic value. They are used so that comparisons can be made with the study drug/treatment.)
  Information about study methods may also include a review of any:
- Eligibility criteria for taking part
- What and how data will be collected
- What is expected to happen during the research
- Review of any potential benefits, side effects, and risks of taking part in the study
- If reimbursements will be provided
- How confidentiality and personal information will be protected
- The right to stop or withdraw consent at any time (without having to give a reason) and how to do this
- How results will be shared and who they will be shared with
- Details of who to contact if you have any questions or complaints

### How can I get involved in research?

## Different Types of Research Studies

Researchers use different types of research studies to understand the factors that lead to the loss of brain cells in Parkinson's. One thing that we know is that in people with Parkinson’s, there is an abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain called Lewy bodies. These Lewy bodies contain a protein called alpha-synuclein, which normally occurs in health brains but builds up in harmful ways in Parkinson’s.

Why this protein builds up and causes brain cell loss in people with Parkinson’s is still unclear. Scientists believe that many factors, rather than just one, may be responsible. These factors develop years before Parkinson’s symptoms appear, and they could include a mix of genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors.

When people will ask, ‘What causes Parkinson’s?’, it’s important to understand that research is still searching for clear answers. Here’s an overview of some key research methods used to study Parkinson’s:

**Epidemiological studies** track groups of people over time to see what differences exist between those who develop Parkinson’s and those who don’t. These studies help identify risk factors that may increase the chances of developing Parkinson’s. For example, researchers have found that factors such as;

- being a male,
- having a history of head injuries,
- drinking less caffeine,
- exposure to presticides and heavy metals

have been associated with Parkinson's. These are examples of ‘environmental factors’ – things people are exposed to during their lives, which may contribute to Parkinson’s.

**Clinical studies** involve medical tests, like blood tests or brain scans, to look for signs that might explain why some people develop Parkinson’s. By comparing results from people with Parkinson’s and those without Parkinson’s, researchers can find patterns or specific biological changes linked to the disease.

**Animal studies** use animals such as mice to create models of Parkinson’s disease. These animals are given symptoms similar to Parkinson’s in humans, allowing scientists to study how the disease affects brain cells and to test potential treatments. Because mice share many biological similarities with humans, these studies help researchers understand how the disease might work in humans.

**Clinical trials** trials test new potential medications to see if they can help slow down or protect against the damage Parkinson’s causes to the brain. These studies not only help find potential treatments but also provide insights into what might cause Parkinson’s in the first place.

## What Links Have Been Found to Parkinson's?

Researchers have identified several factors that may be linked to Parkinson’s disease, though much is still being discovered. Here’s what has been discovered so far:

- **Ageing** – The risk of developing Parkinson’s increases significantly with age. Although some people develop Parkinson’s under the age of 50 (known as young-onset Parkinson’s), this is much less common. Why ageing plays such a big role is still not fully understood, but older age remains the strongest known risk factor.
- **Genetics** – In rare cases, Parkinson’s can run in families due to specific genetic mutations. If a family has several family members with Parkinson’s, it is often due to inherited genes. However, this only accounts for a small percentage of cases. Research suggests that for about 30% of people with Parkinson’s, a combination of certain genes and environmental factors might increase the risk of getting Parkinson’s disease.
- **Changes in Brain Cell Function** – Studies on animals and humans have shown that nerve cells in the brain become more vulnerable to damage. Key parts of these cells, such as the energy cells (mitochondria) and defence cells (immune cells), can come under attack or stop working properly, which could lead to Parkinson’s.
- **Role of Gut Microbiome Gut/Brain Axis** – Research suggests that changes in one’s defence (immune system) affects how the gut and brain talk to each other i.e., the gut/brain axis and could start off a process that, many years later, leads to Parkinson’s. This is not yet fully understood. Further information can be found [here](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-brain-connection).

It is beyond the scope of this website to outline all current studies in Parkinson’s as it is an ever-developing landscape, yet we hope this gives some background on how research is helping to unlock the causes and empower you to find out more, should you wish to do so.

### Key Points

- Multiple factors: Parkinson’s is likely caused by a combination of factors that interact, possibly starting decades before the symptoms appear.
- Varied risk: The risk factors will vary between one person with Parkinson’s and another.
- Ongoing research: Many types of research are being conducted to better understand the causes of Parkinson’s.
- Potential links: Some factors linked to Parkinson’s include genetics (though not for everyone), head injuries, brain inflammation, oxidative stress, and aging, but the exact role of these factors is still unclear.
- Healthy Lifestyle: Apart from living a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise, there is currently no known way to prevent or slow down Parkinson’s.

As research evolves, we will learn more, and understanding these research principles may make help you feel more confident in following future research developments.

## New Drug and Treatment Trials

There are lots of drug and treatment trials taking place in Parkinson’s disease today! Some studies aim to improve current treatments, while others focus on discovering new treatments or potential cures. As Parkinson’s affects everyone differently, it is likely that no single treatment will work for all patients.

Scientists are exploring a wide range of treatment options to slow down or stop the progression of Parkinson’s. The graphic to the side represents the various research directions being explored. Several boxes are left blank to show that the list is not exhaustive – new treatment options are emerging quickly.

**Example: CUE1 Devices** – Devices such as the CUE1 can come in many different shapes and forms to help manage Parkinson’s symptoms. The CUE1, an example that people with Parkinson’s often ask about, is worn on the chest and delivers focussed vibrations (vibrotactile stimulation) to help with motor symptoms in Parkinson’s. Learn more about the <a href="https://charconeurotech.com" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CUE1 device</a>.

While trials are still ongoing to better understand how effective it is, the CUE1 device, unlike most products still being researched, can be bought privately – there is currently a waiting list.
