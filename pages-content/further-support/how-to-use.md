This section helps you to review 56 symptoms that may be linked to Parkinson's. Everyone's experience of Parkinson's is different, and symptoms can change over time.

What you can do:
- Record which of 56 symptoms you are experiencing.
- Say how much each symptom bothers you.

When to complete:
- It is recommended that you complete a symptom review every 6-months, or when you notice changes in your symptoms.
  
What happens next:
- Your answers will update the list of symptoms you track in the My Tracker section.
- A PDF document is created which you can download.
- You can use the PDF documents to compare past symptom reviews and take them along to your appointments with healthcare professionals.

How to start:
- To get started, click the 'Add Symptom Review' button. This will take you to a new page where all of the symptoms are listed. Within this page you will have the option to review how bothersome each symptom is, selecting 'not at all', 'not much', 'a bit', or 'a lot'. If you select an option that says a symptom is bothersome for you, then an optional drop down will appear where you can add more information about that symptom. You can fill in as much or as little information on this symptom review as you would like.

For each symptom, there will be a link to more information about the symptom. If you are completing a section about a symptom, and want to find out more, click the underlined word next to 'learn more' to open a new tab with information. You can read the extra information now and then come back to your symptom review or finish your symptom review first and read the information later.


My Wellbeing

This section of the toolkit helps you to look at:

- What you are currently doing to stay well
- Any challenges you may be facing (e.g., with daily activities)
- What you want to work on to feel better

You can then set Wellbeing Priorities to help you overcome some of these challenges and improve your wellbeing. Completing this section shows what you are already doing and helps you to think about things you might want to try to help your Parkinson's.

How it works:
The first time you view the My Wellbeing section, you will need to complete 3 sections:

Section 1: Think about how things are for you now
Section 2: Write down any challenges you are currently facing
Section 3: Based on what you have entered in the previous two sections, choose a wellbeing priority you would like to work towards.

</iframe>
</div>

After choosing a wellbeing priority, you can:

Break it down into more detail and smaller steps
Write ideas to help you reach this priority
Think about what might be easy or hard when working towards this priority
Plan how to overcome any challenges you might face
A wellbeing priority might look like identifying and attending a weekly exercise or social group; reading a certain number of pages per day of a book you want to read; planning for a holiday you have coming up; trying to eat more fibre and wholegrain foods.

Reflection section:
Two weeks after you create a wellbeing priority, the Reflection section will unlock. To access this, click the 'Continue with this priority' button to:

Reflect on how you have found testing out one or more of these ideas
Review what worked well
Note what has been challenging
Add in some new ideas or plan your next steps
You can keep trying new ideas to achieve your wellbeing priority and reflecting on your progress for as long as is needed. When you feel happy with the progress you have made then you can 'Complete and archive' the wellbeing priority which will move it to the 'View Completed Priorities' section.

How often to complete:
It is recommended to complete Sections 1 and 2 every 6-months or when things change. Try to update Section 3 at least every month to keep track of the wellbeing priorities you are working towards and how things are going.


My Tracker 

The My Tracker section helps you to keep track of your health and daily activities. There are six tabs within this sections and it is recommended to start by filling in the health conditions, health profile, and medications tabs. Following this, you can then start tracking symptoms and activities to view them on the chart alongside your medications.

When you open the My Tracker page, you will see six tabs:

- Symptoms

Getting started:
When you first visit the My Tracker section, we recommend you start by filling in the following tabs: 'health conditions', 'health profile', and 'medications'.

There are personalised sections which are interactive (Symptom Review, My Wellbeing, My Tracker, and Reminders & Notes) along with a wide variety of information pages to help you live well with Parkinson's. 


## How to Personalise


You might find it useful to consider what types of questions could help you to analyse the data you’ve entered into the tracker. For example:

- At what times of the day am I usually available to start a new exercise or activity?
- How do I typically feel after regularly completing a specific activity?
- What do I hope to learn from tracking this data, and how long do I plan to continue recording it?
- Is there a pattern between when I take specific medication and how I feel or notice certain symptoms?

Here are some questions you might explore by entering data into the tracker:

- “_At what times of the day are my symptoms less severe?_”
- “_When does my medication wear off, am I taking it on time?_”
- “_On which days and at what times am I available to start a new habit?_”
- “_How many hours do I spend on a particular activity?_”

_**Tip 1:** Setting reminders can also be helpful. You might want to set monthly, 6-monthly, or pre-appointment reminders to look back at the toolkit and the data you have entered, such as using the symptom review section. For example, you can set a calendar reminder to log in to the toolkit regularly._

_**Tip 2:** It can be helpful to complete the symptom review section ahead of your appointments to help you reflect on your experiences and decide what you might like to focus on. You could even set calendar email reminders to complete this section in advance and print the pages to bring to your appointment._

Each section of the tracker has its own dedicated video tutorial to help you navigate and get the most out of the tracker (see above).

Important Reminders
Trust: Only share data with individuals you trust.

Active Communication: Healthcare teams do not routinely monitor this data. If you have concerns, contact them directly.

## Self-Management

### What is self-management, and why is it important?

Self-management means increasing your knowledge, skills and confidence to manage your own health and care. This includes learning and developing skills about how you can manage Parkinson’s, making informed and conscious choices on what is right for you and working with your healthcare team.

### Why focus on self-management?

How can becoming empowered help you self-manage?

Benefits of Self-Management:

- Understanding your condition can empower you to ask questions and be more involved in making decisions about your health.
- Helps you to monitor your condition, know when to get help and who to speak to. This can give you a greater sense of control and cut down your appointments.

## Making Changes & Keeping on Track

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/keep-on-track.jpg" alt="keeping-on-track" class="content-image">

Although everyone’s condition and circumstances are different, everyone has ups and downs. This can make it hard to ‘follow a plan’. There are different ways to approach this difficulty.

Tips to consider:

1. **Think about what is important to you:** Focus on things that are important to you to keep you motivated.
2. **Break it down:** If a task or ambition feels big, break it down into a series of smaller steps.
3. **Set a realistic target or aim:** This is like making a New Year resolution. It should be specific and something you can achieve, so that you feel encouraged when you meet it.
4. **Work with your body:** Try to use the good times and don’t be too hard on yourself during the difficult times. If symptoms are getting in the way, read the symptom pages for tips on managing them.
5. **Record progress:** Some people find it helpful to keep a log of what they are doing.

- You could add your planned actions in <a href="/information/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders & Notes_</a> and check it off when completed.
- You could enter your activities to the <a href="/information/my-tracker" class="internal-link">_My Tracker_</a> to keep a record.
  This can also help you see which times are better for you than others.

6. **Reflect:** If something is not going as you’d hoped, think about why. What could you do differently? You might need to break it down into even smaller steps to make progress.
7. **Reward:** If it’s going well, reward yourself.
8. **Forming a habit:** If you want to do something on a regular basis, you want to make it automatic, like a habit. This takes persistence over time. For most people it takes about 3months for a regular activity to become a habit. To help:

- You could try associating the task with something that is already part of your routine, like brushing your teeth, or watching a scheduled TV programme. This gives an anchor.
