# Organisational Level: Healthcare and Social Care in the UK

In the UK, healthcare and social care are **separate systems**. Costs, access, and services differ depending on whether care is provided by the **NHS**, local councils, or privately.  

---

## Healthcare

- **Free at the point of access** for UK residents. Overseas visitors may be charged.  
- Covers **prevention, treatment, and care** for illness, injury, or disability. Examples include GP check-ups, hospital care, and physiotherapy.  
- Services are split into levels:  
  - **Primary Care:** First point of contact (GPs, A&E).  
  - **Secondary Care:** Hospital and community care following referral from primary care. Can be planned, urgent, or emergency.  
  - **Tertiary Care:** Highly specialized services (e.g., neurosurgery) following referral from secondary care.  
- Some services are commissioned nationally, others locally. Availability may vary by area.  

---

## Social Care

- **Financially assessed** based on income and savings.  
- Provides **support for daily living and social interaction**, promoting independence and protecting vulnerable people. Examples include:  
  - Home care for washing, dressing, and meals  
  - Supported living environments  
  - Home adaptations  
- Some needs may be covered by the NHS under **Continuing Healthcare (CHC)**.  

---

## Private Healthcare

- Offers **shorter waiting times** but at a fee (unless covered by insurance).  
- To access via insurance, referrals from a GP are usually needed.  
- Accessing private healthcare **does not affect NHS entitlement**, but the services are separate.  
- Considerations for private care:  
  - Ensure the professional matches your needs (e.g., dietitian vs nutritionist, psychologist vs psychotherapist vs psychiatrist).  
  - Verify expertise, registration, and regulatory compliance.  
  - Check provider ratings with the **Care Quality Commission (CQC)**.  

---

## Private Social Care

- Arrange a **Needs Assessment** through your local council Adult Social Care department.  
- If eligible, a **Financial Assessment** determines council contribution.
