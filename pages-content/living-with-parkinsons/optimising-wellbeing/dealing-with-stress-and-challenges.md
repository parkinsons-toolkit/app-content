Stress can often make symptoms such as tremor worse. Learning how to cope with stressful life events can help you to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life.

Even when emotionally and mentally healthy, you may still experience negative emotions, these are part of normal life. Having good emotional health means developing the ability to bounce back from difficult situations.

Below are some suggestions to promote emotional wellbeing and help you feel more in control when dealing with stress. When you have read them through, spend some time thinking about how you might incorporate some of the tips into your routine.

## What can I do?

### Activity

Being more active can help to combat stress. For some people, Parkinson’s makes it tricky to stay active. You may have to adapt the type of activity you do. Some may choose to go to the gym or join a sports team; others may need something they can do at home. One effect of the COVID pandemic has been a considerable increase in the amount and range of exercise classes available online, through platforms such as Zoom.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/yoga-stretch.jpg" alt="yoga" class="dealing-with-stress-and-challenges__yoga-stretch">

Achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as making small changes to your everyday routines, for example:

- Tidying up a bit faster when doing the housework
- Walk one or two flights of stairs if possible and then take the lift
- Leaving the car at home for short journeys
- Getting off the bus a stop earlier and walking the rest of the journey
- Put things you commonly use on a higher shelf, so you have to stretch to reach them

See our <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> page for more guidance or visit <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/physical-activity-and-exercise" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> and see their exercise page for more advice.

### Diet

The food we eat can affect the way we feel, both physically and mentally. And in turn, how we feel can affect the food we eat. So, healthy eating habits are important for improving our mood and general sense of wellbeing.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/dietitian.jpg" alt="dietician" class="dealing-with-stress-and-challenges__dietitian">

Research recommends the following advice on how to follow a healthy, balanced diet:

- Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day (e.g., try adding an extra portion of vegetables to your dinner or add a fruit snack into your day)
- Eat healthy portions of food
- Eat the right balance of food groups (carbohydrates, dairy, meat, fish, etc.)
- Eat regular meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch and dinner)
- Drink plenty of fluids (at least 6–8 glasses a day)

### Sleep

Getting good-quality sleep is vital for our mental wellbeing. There are a few things you can try to help improve the amount and quality of your sleep, including:

- Going to bed at the same time each night
- Leaving yourself time to wind down before bed (e.g. avoid using electronic devices for an hour before you go to bed as these may have a negative effect on sleep)
- Writing a “to do” list for the next day before bed can help to clear your mind of any distractions
- Making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable

**Tip:** Some people find it helpful to write down exactly what they do each night before bed. That can raise awareness of your evening routines and help you think about how you might change that routine to help you sleep better.

If you are experiencing sleep disturbance, see the <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/sleep" class="internal-link">_Sleep Disturbances_</a> page and <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/dreams" class="internal-link">_Dreams_</a> .

### Relaxation

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/relaxing-mindful.jpg" alt="relaxing" class="dealing-with-stress-and-challenges__relaxing-mindful">

Doing something relaxing can help to reduce stress and improve your mental wellbeing. Although life can be busy, it is important to try to do things you enjoy. This might be listening to music, reading a book, going for a walk, or getting creative by painting or colouring. You might try to carve out a regular time or times in your daily routine for a relaxation activity.

They also describe relaxation exercises you can try. You can find more links to useful information and guidance at the bottom of this page.

### Breathing strategies

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/breathing.jpg" alt="breathing-exercise" class="example-class">

Practising breathing techniques can help you to learn how to breathe more deeply and feel calmer.

</div>

Here’s a simple breathing exercise you can try, which will take no longer than 5 minutes:

- Get into a position you find comfortable (this can be standing, sitting, lying, etc.)
- Try to keep your shoulders down and relaxed. Place your hand on your stomach.
- Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach rise as you breathe in and fall as you breathe out.
- You may find it useful to count steadily as you breathe; “one, two, three, four, five” as you breathe in and “one, two, three, four, five” as you breathe out. Try to work out what feels comfortable for you.
- Repeat for 3–5 minutes

### Complementary therapies

Complementary therapies (e.g., reflexology, aromatherapy or massage) are used alongside other treatments. Some people with Parkinson’s report positive experiences of complementary therapies such as finding them relaxing, improved sleep, and reduced anxiety.

</div>

Some complementary therapies are eaten or applied to the skin. Some of these can interact with other medications you might take. Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson's nurse before you use these.

See our <a href="/information/treatments/complementary-therapies" class="internal-link">_Complementary Therapies_</a> page for more information.

### Problem-Solving Therapy

Problem-solving therapy (PST) aims to help you cope better with stressful life events (e.g. financial problems, managing with a long-term condition). It does this by teaching you problem-solving skills you can use to help you find solutions to issues.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/problem-solve.jpg" alt="problem-solve" class="dealing-with-stress-and-challenges__problem-solve">

Here is some guidance on how you can work through problem-solving therapy by yourself:

1. **Choosing a problem**

   - The problem must be something that can be changed and defined clearly:
     - Vague problem: “I’m anxious”
     - More specific problem: “I feel anxious in the evenings and struggle to sleep”

2. **Pursuing an idea**

   - Once the problem has been clearly defined, the next stage is to create one or more achievable ideas that might help you solve the problem:
     - Example: “I will fit in 20 minutes of breathing exercises into my evening routine”

3. **Planning ahead and foreseeing barriers**

   - Once you have thought of an idea (could be more than one), you will need to develop steps for how you’re going to do it. Think about barriers you might face and how to overcome them. Example below:
     - Step: At 9pm every night I will engage in specific breathing exercises that I have located from the _Live Well with Parkinson’s_ toolkit
     - Barriers: I forget or I feel I don’t have time
     - Ways to overcome barrier: set a reminder, always do exercises before brushing teeth so it becomes routine, let a partner know and ask them to remind you

4. **Explore how you feel after the step has been carried out**
   - Think about whether the steps helped solve the problem
   - If there were difficulties carrying out the steps, think about the following questions:
     - Should the steps be defined more clearly?
     - Is the step realistic?
     - Have new problems occurred which I didn’t plan for at the beginning?

It’s important to keep in mind that the goal of PST is not to solve all problems. Instead, the goal is to learn more effective problem-solving skills. This will then help you to cope more effectively with life stressors and feel more in control of your life.

See the <a href="/information/my-wellbeing" class="internal-link">_My Wellbeing_</a> section for more on how to do problem solving therapy.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “Sometimes I find if things get too stressful for me or I’m having a bad day I get a colouring book – you know those adult ones? Or people do word searches, write down their thoughts or go for a walk; just different ways people can deal with if they’re having a bad day or.”

> “When you sit there with Parkinson’s, you think, ‘I can’t do that, I can’t do this, I can’t go here,  
> I can’t go there. I can’t eat this,’ what about all the things you can do, you forget. I don’t dwell  
> on the bad stuff, and the good stuff sometimes takes my mind away from the bad stuff. I can manage it a little bit better.”
