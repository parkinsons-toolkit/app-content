# Research

To help you decide if you would like to take part or not the researchers will be able
to tell you all about their study and what will be involved if you decide to take part.
Who can get involved in research?
Researchers will often need both people with and without Parkinson’s to take part
in studies. This is so that information about people with a diagnosis of Parkinson’s
can be compared with those who do not have the condition.
Each study has guidelines about who can or cannot take part in the study. These
guidelines are called eligibility criteria. These will vary between studies depending
on what the research aims to do.
Researchers will explain their eligibility checklist before asking you to sign up to the
study. This is to make sure it is suitable for you to take part.
What d oes t aking p art i nvolve?
Studies vary in their design depending on
what the research is aiming to do.
Before taking part in a study, a researcher
will make sure that you have been told all
about the study. You will also have the
chance to ask questions. You will then be
asked to sign a consent form. This shows
that anyone taking part in research
has completed informed consent, understands the purpose, benefits, and
potential risks of taking part in the study, and has agreed to take part. See ‘Your
rights as a research participant’ for more information on informed consent. For a
list of helpful questions you can ask researchers to help you better understand the
study, see the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) ‘Be Part of Research’
site, which you can find in our More Information section.
Although most research relies on volunteers, and people are not paid to take part,
studies will often be able to cover your expenses (i.e. the cost of travelling to the
place of research). The research can also sometimes take place in your own home,
but this will depend on the type of study. The study team will be able to tell you
how this will be managed for their study.

Your rights as a research participant
Before anyone can take part in any research study they should have the chance to
read information about the study. You should have the chance to ask any
questions so that you understand what you will have to do.
The study information should also outline your rights as a participant and include the
following information:

- Who is doing the research
- The purpose of the research
- Information about the study methods.

This could include a study drug, a

talking therapy, or a placebo. (A
placebo is an inactive substance or
treatment designed to have no

therapeutic value. They are used so
that comparisons can be made with the study drug/treatment.)
Information about study methods may also include a review of any:

- Eligibility criteria for taking part
- What and how data will be collected
- What is expected to happen during the research
- Review of any potential benefits, side effects, and risks of taking part in the

study

- If reimbursements will be provided
- How confidentiality and personal information will be protected
- The right to stop or withdraw consent at any time (without having to give a
  reason) and how to do this

- How results will be shared and who they will be shared with
- Details of who to contact if you have any questions or complaints
  How can I get involved in research?
  You can find out about current Parkinson’s research studies through the following
  ways:
- National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) – ‘Be Part of Research’
  website o ‘Be Part of Research’ is an online service which provides
  information about what research is. It also helps you find studies you may
  be able to take part in.
- Use their search tool to find current UK research into conditions that are of
  interest to you, or studies that are taking place in your local area. You will
  then be provided with contact details so you can find out more information
  and ask to take part.
- Parkinson’s UK website o The ‘Take Part Hub’ can help you find research
  studies taking place in your local area
- Ask your Parkinson’s nurse, or specialist about research taking place that
  may be suitable.
  If you have any tips please tell a member of the study team or email

  Different Types of Research Studies Different types of research studies have been set-up to understand the factors that lead to the brain cell loss in PD.
  What we do know is that there is an abnormal build-up of proteins in the brain called Lewy
  bodies and within these Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein/a-synuclein (a protein that naturally
  occurs in the brain).
  Why this happens remains unknown. It is likely that no one single factor is enough to
  develop PD. Instead, it is likely a combination of factors that occur, many years before the
  disease becomes apparent (i.e., before symptoms develop).
  Often, people with ask ‘what causes Parkinson’s?” what follows is a brief overview of
  research studies and overall themes in Parkinson’s research. All research tends to ask a
  question, then uses different techniques to try to answer i

  gets older, the risk of Parkinson’s steeply increases with age. Why this is, is not fully
  understood.
  Genes – certain genes for Parkinson’s can run in families but this is rare and often several family members will have had Parkinson’s in these cases. As research emerges, it is thought
  that certain genes may, in combination with environmental factors, increase the risk of
  getting Parkinson’s disease, this is only believed to be in around 30% of people with
  Parkinson’s.
  Changes in the way the brain cell’s function – animal and human studies have found that nerve cells can be vulnerable to damage. Certain part of the cells can come under attack or
  stop working properly such as the energy cells (mitochondria) and defence cells (immune
  cells).
  Role of Gut microbiome gut/brain axis –Research suggests that changes in one’s defence (immune system) affects how the gut and brain talk to each other i.e., the gut/brain axis and
  could start off a process that, many years later, leads to Parkinson’s. This is not yet fully
  understood.
  It is beyond the scope of this website to outline all current studies in PD as it is an ever-
  developing landscape, yet we hope this gives some background on how research is helping
  to unlock the causes and empower you to find out more, should you wish to do so.
  This is a link for further details [https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-brain-connection. Key Point](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/gut-brain-connection. Key Point)s - It is likely that there is no one single factor causing PD, but a combination of factors that interact with
  each other, perhaps even several decades before the onset of the symptoms
- The factors will vary between one person with PD and another
- Various types of research are trying to understand these causes
- Several factors have shown some association with PD, yet most remain unclear at to their exact role,

these factors include – in part genetics (but not in everyone with PD), head injuries, inflammation in the
brain, changes to the way the brain cells function oxidative stress etc. and aging.

- As research evolves, more will be known, understanding research principles may make you feel more
  confident to look at research.
- Apart from living a healthy lifestyle, including exercise, it is currently unknown what one can do

throughout their life to prevent PD from occurring or progressing.

New drug trials - up to date treatments as of [date] and what is possible in the future Commented [SA1]: I think this really has 2 parts –
updating the treatment section and updating the research

There are lots of drug and treatment trials taking place in Parkinson’s disease today! Some trying to improve treatments we
already have, others at finding new treatments and potential cures. It is likely that one treatment won’t ‘fit all’, as everyone with Parkinson’s is different. Below is a picture to represent the range of avenues scientists are taking to explore treatment options that can help stop
Parkinson’s disease progressing. Several boxes have been left blank as this is by no means all-inclusive and new avenues are
developing quite quickly.
