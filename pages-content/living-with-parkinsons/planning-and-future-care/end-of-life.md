# Preparing for End of Life
Regardless of health conditions, for many people, the thought of dying is wrapped up in fear and uncertainty. Attitudes are influenced by culture, religion, family and our life experiences. 

If you are ready to think about your future, there are some things you can think about now. These can be a positive and empowering way to prepare.

## Preparation

### Loved Ones
Are there people you want to see or conversations you want to have before you die? This may be reconnecting, settling a row or telling someone you love them. 
 
How do you want to be remembered? Some people like to write letters or put together memory boxes for their loved ones. 

### Communicating Your Wishes
Towards the end of life, it may become more difficult to communicate your wishes. Planning in advance can help to make sure your wishes are respected: both for your care and for after death.

- Consider writing an **Advanced Statement** or Advanced Care Plan. This is a record of your wishes. If you were unable to express your wishes this must be taken into consideration.
- Consider making an **Advance Decision**. This is also known as Living Will. This is a record of wishes to refuse specific medical treatments under specific circumstances. When valid and applicable, it is legally binding. If you have one, make sure people know where it is kept.
- Consider appointing a **Lasting Power of Attorney**. This is where you can legally nominate someone to make decisions for you. There is a formal process to follow which includes notifying essential people. Make sure your loved ones and care providers know whom you have nominated.
- A **Will** is a legal document that expresses how you wish for your property (including money and possessions) to be allocated after your death. If you do not have a will, there are standard rules that dictate how this happens. Make or check your will and make sure that your loved ones know where it is kept.
- Do you have wishes for your body after your death? Your wishes can be written in an Advanced Statement. Some can also be planned or arranged in advance, for example:
  - Registering to donate to research (more below)
  - Registering for organ donation (more below) o Burial or cremation
  - Funeral plans
 
For more information on formalising Advanced Decisions and Lasting Power of Attorney, see the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">_Legal Matters_</a> page. 
 
For guidance on what to include in an Advanced Statement or Advanced Decision, see the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/planning-and-future-care/future-care-options" class="internal-link">_Future Care Options_</a> page. 

### Practical Preparation
Consider legal and financial matters. Are there loose ends to tie up? Are there details you need to share? If you care or provide financially for others, think about the arrangements for their future. 
 
The Citizen’s Advice website has more information on the legal and financial aspects. Their local offices can help you find a solicitor if you do not have one. 

Legal and financial details that are helpful to securely record: 
- Your records of wishes (as above).
- Bank account, debit cards, credit cards.
- Loans, mortgages, standing orders, direct debits.
- Accountant, tax or financial advisor, solicitor
- State benefits, pensions.
- Tax references.
- Inheritance tax matters: large financial gifts from the last 7 years.
- Property (ownership or rental), key holders and utility providers.
- Insurance policies.  

Other practical considerations: 
- Pets, and their welfare needs.
- Online accounts or social media accounts.
- Significant possessions, such as computers, phones, cars.
- Health contacts.
- Carer or care agency contacts.
- Employer details.

## Place of Care
The <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page covers options for places of care. Here we consider options for places of care for someone who knows they are close to dying. 

There can be practical difficulties in moving to a new place of care if someone is dying. Understanding preferences can help to plan for it where possible. When making such decisions it is helpful to know what **Palliative Care** services are and what they can offer. 

### Own home or home of a loved one
- There are services available to help support care at home at the end of life.
- Services may have different options for end of life care compared to earlier in life.
- Equipment can be supplied or recommended to support staying at home.
- Details of what is available will depend on where you live. This can vary, for example how often someone could come to your home.
- You can talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team about this. They may refer you to a **Palliative Care** team to help support this process.
- Some people prefer to be at home. The advantages are:
  - Familiar environment.
  - Comfortable.
  - Relatively private.
  - Family close.
- However:
  - There can be difficulties with practical support if someone is not there all of the time.
  - Some people feel lonely if they live alone. 

### Care home
- Many nursing homes have experience of caring for people at the end of life.
- Sometimes 	additional 	specialist 	support 	is offered by a community Palliative Care team.
- Some people prefer this option:
  - There is always a member of staff around. o They have experience in caring for people.
  - They tend to have private rooms, so can maintain a peaceful and private environment.
  - They provide long-term care so can become a real home.
- However:
  - For some people, it doesn’t feel like home. o Some people have negative associations with care homes.
- Care homes allow planned visits so you or your family could look around to help make this decision.

### Hospice
- Hospices are places that provide specialist care. They support people with a life-limiting or terminal illness. The focus is on improving quality of life.
- They are primarily charity-funded care, and are a limited resource.
- Some people prefer this option. The advantages are:
  - There is always a member of staff around. o They are highly specialised in caring for people at the end of life.
  - They tend to have private rooms. This means there can be a peaceful and private environment.
- However:
  - For some people, it doesn’t feel like home.
  - Some people have negative associations with hospices.
  - Since they are a limited resource, it is not always possible to go to a hospice for end of life care.
- You can visit most hospices to help make this decision. 

### Hospital
- Many people spend the end of their life in hospital.
- Many hospitals try to allocate a single room where possible when someone is at the end of life, but this is not always possible.
- Some people prefer this option:
  - There is always a member of staff around.
- However:
  - Hospitals are more likely to be noisy and less peaceful.
  - Private rooms are not guaranteed.

## Medicines towards end of life 
If the end of life is expected to be near, care tends to prioritise comfort and dignity 
 
A person’s _usual medication_ may not be appropriate if they are nearing end of life. Medicines may be reviewed. These decisions are unique for the individual but generally involve: 
- Stopping medicine intended only for long term benefit (such as tablets to lower cholesterol).
- Continuing medicine for current symptoms (such as pain killers).

This is a delicate balancing act. Parkinson’s medicines are used to improve symptoms and so in general should be continued. They should be optimised where possible, to achieve best control of symptoms. The benefits and side effects must be considered, and these can change over time. 

Conditions also change over time: for example, many people develop difficulty in swallowing pills. This may require a change, for example to medicine given as a patch on the skin (e.g. rotigotine patch). 
 
If someone is nearing end of their life, it is good to prepare for symptoms that may happen. This may involve getting medicine just in case it is needed. These ‘anticipatory’ medicines may include medicine to control pain, breathlessness, distress or agitation, nausea and secretions. These are considered for anyone near the end of life and are not specific to any medical condition. However, the _choice_ of these medicines should take Parkinson’s into consideration:
- Haloperidol, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine (used for sickness) should generally be avoided even in palliative care for people with Parkinson’s. They can worsen Parkinson’s symptoms.
- Alternatives such as cyclizine or ondansetron should be considered for nausea.
- Domperidone is suitable in Parkinson’s (but is not given by injection). 

When a person is dying, they may not be able to take pills so small injections may be used. These injections go just under the skin, rather than via a drip into a vein. If the medicine injection is needed very regularly, a ‘pump’ to give the medicine continuously under the skin may be considered.

## After Death

### Who to contact after the death of a loved one 
This can understandably be a very upsetting and disorientating time. It is helpful to know in advance who it would be helpful to contact when the time comes. These include the GP, the nursing home manager, or the nursing staff if it occurred in hospital. Also, the Palliative care or Parkinson’s nurse will be able to offer support and advice. You may also like to contact the leader of your faith organisation e.g. priest, rabbi or minister. They can help you to find a funeral director, who will be able to advise further.

### Practical tasks 
After the death of someone there are a number of tasks that will need to be completed. 
- Practical tasks after someone dies includes registering the death and making funeral arrangements. Further information about practical tasks can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Government website/a> – Search “what to do after someone dies”.

### Bereavement
- Every person processes bereavement differently. It can be a difficult time for everyone.
- Many people use their existing social support, such as family and friends, to help them through. Some benefit from more information, support or counselling.
- Bereavement support is offered by many charities as well as local hospice and NHS services. For example, you could look at the Cruse Bereavement Care charity website.
- Try looking at the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS website</a> (search “bereavement”) or speak to your GP for more information.

### Organ and Tissue Donation
- Many people are in need of organ transplants or tissues.
- The NHS have a register for those who are willing to donate their organs and tissues after their death.
- You can join this register when you register with a GP, apply for a driving licence, or by contacting them directly: <a href="https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/</a>
- You should also discuss your wishes with your loved ones as they would be contacted about it. 

## Donation to medical science
- You can arrange to leave your body for medical science: that is for research or training. For more information go to  <a href="https://www.hta.gov.uk/guidance-public/body-organ-and-tissue-donation/body-donation-medical-schools" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTA (Human Tissue Authority) – Body Donation</a>.
- Much research into Parkinson’s is ongoing. Some research looks at the bodies of people who had Parkinson’s after they have died to help understand the condition better
- The charity Parkinson’s UK support a Brain Bank dedicated to Parkinson’s research, based at Imperial College London. For more information, see the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/research/parkinsons-uk-brain-bank" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK Brain Bank Website</a>.
