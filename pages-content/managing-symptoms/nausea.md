## What might be causing it?

Both Parkinson’s itself and the drugs used to treat it can cause nausea. Nausea that started after recently starting any new drug should go away on its own with time.

Constipation can cause nausea and is common in Parkinson’s. It can occur years before movement problems start. Please see the page on <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/bowels" class="internal-link">_Bowel Symptoms_</a> for more information.

An illness called gastroparesis can cause nausea. This is common in Parkinson's. It occurs when the stomach empties into the gut very slowly. It can cause changes, e.g., nausea, vomiting and feeling full after eating a small amount of food. This can lead to weight loss and dehydration.

Nausea may have a cause not related to your Parkinson’s. Common causes include anxiety or stress, stomach problems such as reflux, food poisoning or ulcers, migraine or infections (e.g. of the urinary tract or inner ear). These conditions will tend to cause other symptoms as well as nausea.

## What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try for yourself (see below). But there are times when you should seek professional help. For example, if you have nausea with other changes (as seen below) or the nausea is concerning you.

If you experience only nausea, you could try some of the things below. If it doesn’t improve in 1 month, seek help from your GP. But if you are concerned see your GP sooner.

**Things to avoid:**

- Do not eat strong-smelling food
- Do not eat spicy overly sweet, fried or greasy food
- Do not eat quickly
- Do not lie down soon after eating
- Do not wear clothes that are tight around your waist

### Nausea after taking Parkinson’s medication

Nausea can occur if you take medications on an empty stomach. Which is why for many medications the advice is to take them with meals. However, with Parkinson’s medications, some people find that it is less effective when taken with a main meal.

If this is a problem for you, try taking your medication at least half an hour before your main meal. Also, with plenty of water and a small snack, such as a biscuit.

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- How long it has been going on for?
- If there is anything that makes it better or worse?
- Symptoms related to your stomach, such as vomiting, weight loss, tummy pain, heartburn, change in bowel habit, problems swallowing.
- The presence of blood in vomit or stool.
- Symptoms related to the ears, such as deafness, dizziness, ringing in ears.
- Whether there is a link to drugs, diet or bowel motions.
- Whether you have had it before, and if so, what made it go away.
- Whether you have had any problems with your stomach in the past, such as ulcers, or a hiatus hernia.
- Lifestyle, e.g. whether you drink alcohol or smoke

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- Nausea could be related to many things. Tracking your symptoms for three days may help to identify a pattern.

### Tests

Tests are not always needed. But your GP or specialist may run further tests such as:

- blood tests,
- a stool sample for infection or inflammation,
- camera test (endoscopy) to look at your food pipe and stomach.

## Further Treatments

### Medication

- Doctors and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurse) may change your drugs.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**

**Medications used for this symptom:**

- Anti-sickness drugs, e.g. domperidone, cyclizine, ondansetron.
  - Domperidone has been shown to be effective in Parkinson’s. But do **not** use it if you have certain heart problems. Do **not** use it long-term.
- Note: Do not use metoclopramide and prochlorperazine. They may worsen symptoms of Parkinson’s.
- Depending on the cause, other drugs may help. For heartburn, e.g. gaviscon, omeprazole, lansoprazole.

**Medications linked to nausea:**

- Most Parkinson’s drugs, e.g. Levodopa.
- Some painkillers, e.g. ibuprofen, codeine, morphine.
- Some antibiotics, e.g. erythromycin.
- Some drugs used for low mood.
- Many cancer drugs.

### Referral

You may be referred on to another service, e.g. dietician or gastroenterologist.
