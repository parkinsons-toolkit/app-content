There are a range of medicines available to help manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s. At present, no medication is known to change or cure the underlying disease process. However, medication can effectively improve the symptoms. Treating symptoms earlier will help you to keep well and active which is beneficial in the longer term. Medicine can be adjusted to match your own symptoms, needs and preferences.

The underlying changes in Parkinson’s are complex. One characteristic of Parkinson’s is reduced levels of **dopamine**. This is a chemical messenger in the brain. Most of the medicines for Parkinson’s work in different ways to improve dopamine messaging.

It can take some time to find the best medicine regime for you. Symptoms change, so your regime may need to change as well. Your Parkinson’s specialist team will work with you to adjust medication and optimise symptom control.

It is important not to change your medication without discussing this with your GP or Parkinson’s team first. Any withdrawal from Parkinson’s drugs must be done gradually.

## Commonly Used Medications

The <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages have guidance for dealing with the side effects that are listed below. If you experience side effects, consult these pages and speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team. There are also other possible side effects that can occur. Some medications cannot be used together with other medications. Your prescribing doctor will take this into account when prescribing medication.

### 1. Levodopa Medications

**What does it do?**

- Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the body.
- Levodopa is combined with another medicine into one pill. This other medicine only prevents the levodopa from being broken down before it gets to the brain.
- This other medicine does not help Parkinson’s symptoms.
- The two medicines are combined into one pill.
- See chart below for common levodopa medications:

**Levodopa medications**

| Generic Name | Brand Names                                                 | Medications Involved   | Forms Available                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Co-careldopa | Caramet®, Sinemet®, Lecado®, Duodopa® (intestinal gel form) | Levodopa + carbidopa   | • Tablets <br> • Controlled release tablets <br> • Modified release tablets <br> • Intestinal gel form (brand name Duodopa®, see additional information below) |
| Co-beneldopa | Madopar®                                                    | Levodopa + benserazide | • Capsules <br> • Dispersible tablets <br> • Controlled release capsules                                                                                       |

**Who is it for?**

- Levodopa can be used at all stages of Parkinson’s.
- Duodopa® intestinal gel is given directly into the gut via a tube – see <a href="/information/treatments/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced & Surgical Treatments_</a> page for more information. It is used for complex movement problems.

**What are the side effects?**  
Not all patients will experience side effects while taking levodopa.

The more common are:

- Nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting – this usually goes away after a couple of weeks. It may be eased by taking the medicine with a small amount of food. Some people use an anti-sickness medicine (e.g. Domperidone) short-term when first starting levodopa.
- Low blood pressure - which can cause symptoms of dizziness or feeling generally weak or faint.
- Sleepiness.
- Levodopa may cause urine to turn reddish-brown. This is harmless.
- With long term use, some people may also experience involuntary movements (dyskinesia) or hallucinations.

Food can affect how levodopa gets absorbed into your body. For some people this impact of food is noticeable. See the <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/eating-well" class="internal-link">_Eating Well_</a> page for more guidance.

### 2. Dopamine Agonist Medications

**What do they do?**

- Dopamine agonists mimic the action of dopamine.

**Dopamine agonist medications**

| Generic Name | Brand Names                                                                                     | Forms Available                                                             |

| Rotigotine   | Neupro®                                                                                         | • Skin patch                                                                |
| Apomorphine  | Apo-go®, Dacepton®                                                                              | • Pre-filled pen for intermittent injection <br> • Continuous infusion pump |

**Who are they for?**

- They can be used at all stages of Parkinson’s and come in a variety of forms.
- Rotigotine is given as a skin patch so may be used if swallowing tablets is a problem.
- Apomorphine is given by injection or infusion pump. It is used for more complex movement problems. More information about the pump can be found on the <a href="/information/treatments/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced & Surgical Treatments_</a> page.

**What are the side effects?**  
Not all patients will experience side effects while taking dopamine agonist medicines. The more common are:

- Sleepiness. Some people may fall asleep suddenly, known as “Sleep Attacks”
- Nausea (feeling sick).
- Low blood pressure, which can cause symptoms of dizziness or feeling generally weak or faint.
- Hallucinations (seeing, hearing, feeling or smelling things that are not there)
- ‘Impulse Control Disorders’(gambling, shopping, binge-eating, hyper-sexuality) - more information can be found on our <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/impulsive-behaviours" class="internal-link">_Impulsive Behaviours_</a> page.
- Lower leg or ankle swelling.

### 3. MAO-B Inhibitor Medications

**What do they do?**

- These reduce the body’s natural breakdown of dopamine so the dopamine you have stays around longer.

| Generic Name | Brand Names         | Forms Available                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rasagiline   | Azilect®            | • Tablets                                                             |
| Selegiline   | Eldepryl®, Zelapar® | • Eldepryl - tablets <br> • Zelapar – tablets that dissolve on tongue |

**Who are they for?**

- They can be used at all stages of Parkinson’s.

**What are the side effects?**

- Side effects are rare but can include abnormal dreams, constipation and a dry mouth.

### 4. COMT Inhibitor Medications

**What do they do?**

- These reduce the body’s natural breakdown of levodopa, so it remains effective for longer and helps the levodopa to work more smoothly.

| Generic Name                | Brand Names                  | Forms Available |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| Entacapone                  | Comtess®                     | Tablets         |
| Co-careldopa and entacapone | Stalevo®, Sastravi®, Stanek® | Tablets         |
| Tolcapone                   | Tasmar®                      | Tablets         |
| Opicapone                   | Ongentys®                    | Tablets         |

**Who are they for?**

- These are used alongside levodopa and must be taken at the same time.
- Opicapone is a once a day medication.

**_What are the side effects?_**

- These medications may cause upset stomach or bowels. Adding fibre to your diet may be helpful as the body adjusts.
- As this medication increases the amount of levodopa in the blood, the side effects listed for levodopa may occur.
- Urine may turn reddish-brown, which is harmless.
- Tolcapone requires regular checks of your liver function.

## Other Medications

### 1) Amantadine

| Generic Name | Brand Names | Forms Available         |

**What are the side effects?**

- Side effects can include memory problems and mental health problems.
- Other side effects may be constipation, difficulty passing urine and dry mouth.

### 3) Other medications

Other medications may be used to treat specific symptoms. See our <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages for more details.

## Side effects of Parkinson’s medications

Although rare, Parkinson’s medication carries a risk of causing unusual behaviour. They are called **Impulse Control Disorders**, which you can read about on out <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/impulsive-behaviours" class="internal-link">_Impulsive Behaviours_</a> symptom page. This means behaviours that are difficult to control. Examples include gambling, shopping, binge-eating, hyper-sexuality. They are more common in people on dopamine agonists.

You and those close to you should watch out for these. If this happens, it is vital to tell your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. A change in your medication may be necessary.

## Who should I talk to about my medication?

Who you should talk to depends on the subject of the query. Although there is some variation in practice, in general:

- Do not change/stop medication without discussion first.

- **Contact your GP for:**

  - Repeat prescriptions
  - If you have a planned medication change with your specialist team, but don’t have it on your prescription yet. The plan should have been recorded in your clinic letter. Note some GPs may want this to be done in an appointment.
  - For medication for another health condition (unless you see a specialist team for this condition, then try contacting that team)

- **Contact your specialist team for:**

  - If you are unsure about a change to your Parkinson’s medication
  - If a change to your Parkinson’s medication has not gone well

- **Speak to a pharmacist about:**
  - General medication advice
  - If you are worried about the impact of one medication on another

## Getting Medication

- Long term medication should be issued on a repeat prescription by your GP.
- You will need to request and collect the repeat prescription. If not, you may run out of the medicine. You can set a reminder to reorder your medicine using the <a href="/information/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders & Notes_</a> section.
- Consider asking your GP surgery if they can send prescriptions directly to the pharmacy.
- Some pharmacies offer home delivery services for people who find it difficult to get out of the house. Ask your pharmacist if this is an issue.

### Prescription charges

- At present, in England, prescriptions are charged per item unless you are exempt. You are exempt if you are over 60 years old. Certain medical or financial circumstances also make people exempt.  
  See the NHS website for more details.
- Having Parkinson’s is not (at present) listed as a reason for exemption from NHS prescription charges.
- A prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) could save you money on NHS prescription costs. See the <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/finances" class="internal-link">_Finances_</a> page for more details.

## Taking Medication

### Packaging

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/medication-pack.jpg" alt="medication-pack" class="example-class">

Getting medications out of their packets can be tricky. Pill ejectors may help:

- Pill ejectors push a pill out of its packaging.
- They are small plastic devices that apply more pressure to the packaging than you can with your bare hands.
- Try not to break your pills when using it.
- Check that there are no stickers or labels on the back of the blister packs. They will make it more difficult to push the pills through.

### Cutting Medicine

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/cutting-medication.jpg" alt="cutting-medication" class="example-class">

Sometimes people are required to take only half or a quarter of a pill. Some find it easier to take smaller size pills.

**Note, not all medicines are suitable to be cut:**

- Controlled release or modified release tablets should not be cut or broken. Cutting interferes with the controlled release mechanism. Examples: Sinemet CR, Ropinirole XL, Pramipexole PR.
- Madopar capsules should not be split. Splitting affects the dose you receive. It would be better to have dispersible Madopar tablets.
- Entacapone or Stalevo can be split to ease swallowing. However, the cut edges taste unpleasant.

**How to cut tablets?**  
Using a _pill cutter_ is more precise than trying to snap pills.

- Usually a lid with a razor-sharp blade, combined with a small plastic container.
- You put the pill inside, bring the lid down, and the pill is cut cleanly in half.
- Use caution when using the cutter to avoid injuries from the blade.

**_Dispersible_ tablets**, such as 'Madopar dispersible', can be dissolved in water.

- To take half a dose: it can be easier to dissolve the whole tablet and only drink half of the mixture, than to cut the tablet in half.

### Using Medication Patches

Medication patches can be a good alternative to tablets for people who have swallowing difficulties.

Instructions should be provided, but in general:

- Apply the patch to clean, dry, healthy skin. Not to irritated or broken skin.
- Apply on the torso, thigh, hip, shoulder or upper arm.
- When applying, press the patch firmly against the skin for about 30 seconds.
- Also remember to remove the patch as instructed (usually when applying the new one).
- Avoid re-using the same area of skin when replacing the patch. Try to avoid re-using the same area of skin for 14 days.

Check your specific instructions, but in general the patches are designed such that they are ok to get wet. However, you should avoid exposing the patch to high temperatures (e.g. hot sunny days or electric blankets). Heat can cause more medicine to pass from the patch into the body than is intended and cause side effects.

If a patch falls off, you will need to apply a fresh one until the time you usually change it. Some people find bandaging tape helpful if the edges of the patch lift off.

_Note: Rotigotine patches contain metal and should be removed before having an MRI scan._

### Swallowing Medicine

Some people have difficulty with swallowing their medication. If this is the case: speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. You may require further assessment or a change to your medicines. For example, this could be using a dissolvable tablet or a patch. See our <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/swallowing" class="internal-link">_Swallowing Difficulties_</a> page for more information.

### Missed Medicines

What to do if you miss a medication depends on:

- How frequently you take the medication
- When you realise it was missed.

_These are general principles relevant to Parkinson’s medication:_

- If you are unsure, then speak to a healthcare professional.
- If you have difficulty remembering medication, read the **Organising Medication** section below.

**The question to ask yourself is: Am I due another dose very soon?**

- **Yes ➔ Skip a dose.**  
  _For example:_
  Mr X normally takes levodopa every 4 hours: at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm.  
   Mr X missed the 8am dose and realised at 11:30am.  
   Mr X could take the dose at 11:30am and skip the 12pm dose.

- **No ➔ Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.**  
  Adjust the rest of your doses for the day to be similar spacing to your normal regime. You may need to bring them slightly closer together (e.g. 30 minutes closer).
  _For example:_
  Mr X normally takes levodopa every 4 hours: at 8am, 12pm, 4pm, and 8pm.  
  Mr X missed the 8am dose and realised at 10:30am.  
  Mr X could take the dose at 10:30am and adjust the later doses to be every 3.5–4 hours: 2pm, 5:30pm, and 9:30pm.

The next day, return back to the normal schedule.

If you miss a tablet later in the day, you may not be able to easily fit all the doses in before bed. Rather than taking them very close together, you may need to miss one out for that day. This can be a tricky judgement to make.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:

> “I find the tablets hard to swallow. I got used to having ice cream with them now that works nicely. I learnt that by trial and error.”
>
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

## Organising Medication

- Some people with Parkinson’s have complicated medication schedules. They can be difficult to remember.
- It is important to be organised and safe with medication. Try to keep them together in a safe and secure place, out of reach of children.
- Medication management aids can help you to stay on top of your medication schedule.
- **Note:** Some medicines should not be stored outside of their original packaging. Check with the pharmacist before changing their storage.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/medication-organiser.jpg" alt="medication-organiser" class="medications__medication-organiser">

### Pill organisers

- These have many different names, including:
  - Dossette boxes
  - Blister packs
  - Medication Compliance Aid (MCA)
  - Multi-dose System (MDS)
- Used to arrange and store medication in compartments, sorted by day and time.
- They may be filled by a pharmacist, or they can be self-filled.
- Can range from 7–28 compartments. If you take your medicine 4 times per day, a 28-compartment device can cover a full week.
- If you need more compartments, you can use two.
- There are different types:
  - Different shapes, e.g. square or round
  - Single use, with compartments sealed with foil
  - Re-useable, with compartments with lids
  - Some have alert functions
  - Automatic pill dispensers: They are set to ‘unlock’ one compartment at a time. This makes sure you are aware when a dose is due. It makes it easier to take the right amount of medication.

### Travel-size pill timers

- Portable devices that hold a small number of medication doses (usually enough for one day).
- They may have a small alarm to remind you when to take your medication.
- They can be useful to ensure you have the medicines you need when you are out and about.

### Medication alerts

- Alert you to take your medication, e.g. with sound, vibration, lights.
- Some pill organisers have alert functions.
- Some advanced devices can send a text message to an emergency contact number if you don’t take a dose within a specified timeframe.
- Many people find timers on mobile phones or digital watches useful.
- Some people prefer vibrating alerts instead of sound or light, to draw less attention.

### How to get these?

- In some select cases, simple pill organisers are provided through the NHS. Speak to your GP or pharmacist to see if you are eligible.
- You can buy them yourself. There are many options online or in supermarkets and chemists.
- You must check your medicines are suitable to be stored in them first. Speak to your pharmacist about this.

### How to choose?

- If you have difficulty using your hands, you might prefer a design that has larger compartments and buttons.
- Simpler pill organisers are better if you have difficulty with your memory or thinking.
- Look for alarms that are easy to set and reset automatically for the next dose.
- Many have ‘pre-set’ alarms that repeat daily. This may or may not be suitable for you, depending on your medication schedule.

**There are also other possible side effects that can occur, and some medications cannot be used together with other medications. Your prescribing doctor will take this into account when prescribing medication.**

## My Experience

> “The advice I would give to people is that you prepare yourself a schedule ….unless you write it down and give yourself something to work to, you can, you can go wrong.”
>
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson's)_

> “My grandchildren have set it up. It comes on, and the alarm goes, ‘Parkinson’s’, so I know to take my tablets.”
