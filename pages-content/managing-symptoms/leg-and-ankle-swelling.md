# Leg or Ankle Swelling
Leg or ankle swelling can commonly occur in people with Parkinson’s. Extra fluid from around the body can settle in the ankles or lower legs. This can be uncomfortable to walk with, make the skin feel tight, legs feel heavy, or shoes feel tight. This extra fluid is known as _oedema_. Muscle movements in the legs help to push some of the fluid back around the body.

## What might be causing it?
Sometimes swelling gets better overnight and then worse when you are up, sitting and moving around during the day. This is called postural oedema. Gravity causes the fluid to build-up around the ankles when they are in a position lower than your knees for long periods of time. This is more common as you get older. Also, if you spend a lot of the day sitting still. It usually affects both legs/ankles and is one of the commonest causes of ankle or lower leg swelling.

Possible causes of leg or ankle swelling in people with Parkinson’s include: 
- Possible side effect of some Parkinson’s medications, such as dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine).
- Not moving as much can cause fluid to collect in the feet, ankles, and lower legs as the muscles are not pushing it back.

Other non-Parkinson’s causes of leg or ankle swelling can be from:
- Blood clots (deep vein thrombosis) if the swelling is confined to one leg, which may also be painful. This is more common in those having treatment for cancer, recent surgery or leg fracture (within 12 weeks), have been in bed for more than 3 days, or have had clots before.
- Infections in the legs – these are typically only on one side and usually cause a red, hot and painful leg.
- Injuries, such as a twisted ankle (you would normally be aware of the injury). It is usually only on one side and is often painful.
- Problems with major organs, such as your heart, liver, or kidney – these are usually either already known about or associated with other symptoms.
- Side effects of non-Parkinson’s medications (e.g. some blood pressure tablets).

## What Should I Do About It?

* **Go to A\&E immediately** if you also experience:

  * Difficulty breathing, or changes in breathing (wheezing, coughing, needing to sleep propped up on pillows)
  * Chest pain

* **Mild swelling in both legs**:

  * If it isn’t too bothersome and none of the urgent symptoms above are present, try the self-care advice below.
  * If it doesn’t improve within a few weeks, book a routine GP appointment.

* **Severe or bothersome swelling**:

  * Book a GP appointment and try the advice below in the meantime.

* **Redness, warmth, wounds, or ulcers over the swelling**:

  * See your GP as soon as possible.

* **New swelling in one leg only, or swelling developing quickly (over hours or days)**:

  * Contact your GP or NHS 111 for an urgent review.

## What Can I Try for Myself?

### Change your feet position

* Swelling often improves overnight when lying flat.
* When resting, sit with your legs straight out and ankles higher than knees, knees higher than hips.
* Try lying flat with legs slightly raised on a pillow 3–4 times a day.

### Increase activity

* Movement and exercise help reduce swelling.
* If seated, raise legs on a footstool and exercise ankles regularly.
* Try ankle movements such as flexing up and down, and moving in the shape of each letter of the alphabet throughout the day.

### Select shoes carefully

* Wear shoes that can be loosened during the day as swelling changes.
* Ensure shoes still hold firmly to avoid falls if they become loose.
* Avoid shoes that are too tight to fasten.
* Shop for shoes when swelling is at its worst to ensure a good fit.

# My Experience

**People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:**

> “I take one day at a time and I try to get him out every day if I can, even if it’s around the block to keep his legs moving.”
> *(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)*

# Further Assessment

## Questions

Healthcare professionals will likely ask you more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your **My Health** section to bring to the appointment.

Things they might ask about:

* Your medication
* The location of the swelling: one leg or both legs, above or below the knee
* Whether it came on quickly (hours/days) or more slowly (weeks/months)
* If part or all of the swelling is red/inflamed, hot, or tender
* If it affects one side more than the other, whether you have:

  * Been immobile for more than 3 days
  * Had recent surgery, fracture, or treatment for cancer (within 12 weeks)
  * Taken a long-haul flight or drive (more than 5 hours)
* Whether you have had swelling before, and what helped
* History of blood clots (personal or family)
* Your breathing: difficulty, shortness of breath, or needing pillows at night
* Any chest pain
* Changes in urine, skin, or eye colour
* Changes in the amount of urine you pass
* Increased bruising
* Weight changes
* Wounds in the swollen areas

**Tracking symptoms** in the *Symptom and Activity Tracker* can help you recall details and identify patterns.

* For ankle swelling, record when the problem started
* Note fluctuations: when it is most/least problematic
* Keep track of ankle/leg exercises

## Tests

Depending on their assessment, they may run further tests such as:

* Blood tests
* Urine tests
* X-rays
* Scans

---

## Further Treatments

You may be given reassurance or specific advice about things you could try yourself.

* You may also be supported by a district or practice nurse.
* Advice could include wearing **support stockings**, but always discuss this with a healthcare professional first.

---

## Medication

* Doctors (e.g. GP, neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may adjust medication.
* **Do not change medication without professional advice.**

### Medications sometimes used for swelling

* **Diuretics** (water pills) such as furosemide – used for swelling caused by heart, liver, or kidney conditions. Less effective for dopamine agonist–related swelling.
* If a particular cause is found, treatment will be tailored to it.

### Medications that may contribute to swelling

* **Parkinson’s medications**: dopamine agonists (e.g. pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine)
* **Blood pressure/heart medications**: calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine)
* **Diabetes medication**: pioglitazone
* **Anti-inflammatory medication**: ibuprofen, naproxen
* **Steroid medication**: prednisolone

*These medications may need to be reduced or discontinued if swelling is problematic.*

## Referral

Specialist referral may be needed:

* For certain causes of ankle swelling
* For fitting compression hosiery

---

# Key Messages

* Swelling can be due to:

  * Decreased movement and exercise
  * Side effects of Parkinson’s medication
  * Causes unrelated to Parkinson’s

* Increasing movement and exercise, and adjusting leg/foot position, can help reduce swelling.
