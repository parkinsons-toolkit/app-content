### Introduction

Reading, writing, and using technology may be more difficult for people with Parkinson’s. This can be due to a combination of factors, which are explored below.

---

### Reading

**Why can it be difficult with Parkinson’s?**  
Eye movements involved in reading are highly complex and must be coordinated to track words on a page.

- **Saccadic eye movements:** Rapid eye movements that allow quick jumps to a new target, important for moving to a new line on the page. In Parkinson’s, these can be slow, making it hard to find the next line. Dyskinesias may cause these movements to become fast.  
- **Vergence eye movements:** Needed for focusing on near or far objects, important for reading. Parkinson’s may impair vergence, causing double vision.  
- Other issues include:  
  - Slowing of eyelid movement, leading to less blinking, causing dry or irritated eyes and blurred vision.  
  - Eyelid spasms (blepharospasm), causing involuntary eye closure.  
  - Some Parkinson’s medications can cause dry eyes.

**What can I try for myself?**  
- Over-the-counter ointments and eye drops can help with dry eyes.

**What else may be helpful?**  
- Regular eye checks for near vision problems, which often worsen with age.  
- If problems persist despite normal eye exams or new glasses, ask your GP, optometrist, or ophthalmologist for a referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist who may prescribe ‘prisms’ (special glasses).  
- See the 5 Senses page for more on visual changes in Parkinson’s.

### Writing

**Why can it be difficult?**  
- Slower hand movement  
- Increased hand stiffness  
- Decreased dexterity (harder to grip/move a pen)  
- Reduced stamina for writing  
- Tremor

**What can I try for myself?**  
- Use fibre-tip or gel ink pens that flow easily.  
- Use pens with grips, wide barrels, or built-in grips for comfort.  
- To improve handwriting size:  
  - Use lined or darkly lined paper underneath light paper to guide writing.  
  - Aim to reach the line with upward pen strokes.  
  - Concentrate on making ‘big and slow’ or ‘smooth and slow’ movements.  
  - Practice hand exercises (see below).

**Hand exercises:**  

1. **Exercise 1:**  
   - Hold hands straight out in front, shoulder height, palms away, fingers extended wide.  
   - Turn hands toward your face, pull back to ribs while making a tight fist.  
   - Alternate between fist and open palm.  
   - Repeat 20 times.

2. **Exercise 2:**  
   - Tap each finger to the thumb on both hands simultaneously, then extend fingers upward.  
   - Repeat twice per finger.

3. **Exercise 3:**  
   - Curl fingers so nails touch the palm base, then extend fingers wide.  
   - Repeat 20 times including thumbs.

**What else may be helpful?**  
- See an occupational therapist for personalized hand exercises and advice. Ask your GP for a referral.  
- Consider a facsimile signature stamp for legal documents if signing is difficult.  
- Explore alternative communication methods like computers.

### Using Technology

**Computers**  
- May help if speaking or writing is difficult, but tremor or stiffness can make usage challenging.

**What can I try?**  
- Use a touchscreen device (tablet or smartphone) instead of a standard keyboard.  
- Use video call apps like Zoom, Skype, Facetime, or Google Meet requiring little typing.  
- Use talk-to-text software to convert spoken words into written text.

**Training & Support:**  
- Age UK may offer computer training.  
- Online Centres Network provides access and advice on computers across 6,000 UK centres.  
- Local libraries may have training opportunities.

**Choosing a device:**  
| Device           | Pros                                                    | Cons                                         |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Tablet**       | Touchscreen, talk-to-text easier, lightweight, portable, built-in camera | May have limited software capability          |
| **Laptop**       | Keyboard, touchpad, built-in camera                     | Heavier, may lack built-in talk-to-text       |
| **Desktop**      | Keyboard and mouse, may have camera                      | Not portable or lightweight, may lack talk-to-text |

### Mobile Phones

**Why can it be difficult for people with Parkinson’s?**  
- Decreased hand strength for holding a phone  
- Tremor  
- Softer voice making it harder to be heard  
- Decreased stamina for holding the phone  

**What can I try for myself?**  
- Hand exercises to increase strength and mobility may help with holding a phone.  
  - See hand exercises in the *Writing* section.  
  - An occupational therapist can provide more specific exercises.  
- Exercises to increase voice volume and clarity may help in conversations.  
  - Speech therapists can identify areas to work on and give exercises; ask your GP for a referral.  
  - **Voice Analyst app:** measures volume and pitch of your voice; useful to track progress with a speech therapist.  
    - Note: There is a fee to download this app.  
  - Singing in a choir, practicing singing (e.g., in the shower), or holding notes loudly and long can help strengthen your voice.
