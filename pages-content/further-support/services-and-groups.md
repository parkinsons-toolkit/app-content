## General Resources

### Your Parkinson’s team or your GP

- _Note you can record their contact details in the About Me section._
- They are available to help with health-related issues and can direct you to other services in the area.
- Your Parkinson’s team should know if there are any support groups connected with the hospital. They may know about support groups outside the hospital too.
- If you can’t get through to the team you know health advice is available via the NHS 111 telephone service, <a href="111.nhs.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS 111 online</a> downloading the NHS App or using the <a href="www.nhs.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS website</a>. However please note that the call handler is not usually a clinician and may not have much experience of Parkinson’s. 

### Your local council
Find your local council by visiting the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK's 'Find your local council'</a> page.

This includes:
- **Adult Social Care:** Also known as ‘social services’. They conduct Needs Assessments. These are the first steps in getting Home Care, equipment and/or home adaptations and housing support. This is who you should contact if daily tasks are becoming more difficult and you think you need help. Note, services are means tested so there may be a cost that is different to healthcare which is free on the NHS. However, the assessment and advice are free. They can also let you know if you may be eligible for some benefits that are not means tested, such as Attendance Allowance. These benefits can help pay for extra help. See our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/appointments-and-hospital-stays" class="internal-link">_Finances_</a> page for more details on this.
- **Parking & Travel**: Blue Badge, bus passes, dial-a-ride services, etc. See our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/travel" class="internal-link">_Travel_</a> page for more details.

### Your workplace
- If you work, your employer has some responsibility for your Health and Safety at work. Your employer should support you with health issues that impact on or are affected by your work.
- Check with your manager, Human Resources (HR) or Occupational Health (OH) department.
- This varies but sometimes includes psychological and physical support. This may be counselling and physiotherapy.
- More information about your rights is available at <a href="www.hse.gov.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK's HSE (Health and Safety Executive)</a>.
- If you are worried about discrimination at work, Citizen’s Advice can help – see below.

- You can find officers from PALS in your local hospital.

## Peer Support
Although it can be a daunting idea, many people find peer support helpful. We have heard this from people with Parkinson’s and research has shown the benefits. It may be social, emotional or practical support but importantly this support is given and received. Sharing experiences can increase your confidence. 

There are different types of peer support: 
- Face-to-face vs online
- Group vs pairs
- Some are based around information sharing, such as having talks. Others are more of a social occasion. Some groups are based around an activity, such as singing or boxing. 

Different groups are aimed at different people, for example: 
- Groups aimed at different ages
- Groups aimed at carers
- Groups of people with a shared experience, for example particular health conditions 

You could try different groups to find what suits you. See what people say about support groups below.

## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences. 
 
> “We had just started, within the church, a group, it’s within the community, called ‘Brain Fit’… it’s basically an afternoon with board games. Or for those who don’t want to do board games, there’s crosswords, sudoku or just the chance to socialise.”
> _(Carer for someone with Parkinson’s)_

> “Being in a group where they’re not feeling judged because actually everyone is going through the same thing as they are, and feeling not alone. It’s just nice to know that you’re not alone.”
> _(Healthcare Professional)_

> “I think Parkinson’s groups are great… they’re great socially. They’re great in terms of finding out about benefits that an individual may not know about [and] accessing services … They can be useful at talking about which specialists people like… also recommending specialist services like physio, like speech and language therapy… especially non-NHS treatments and things like psychological support and talking based therapies...”
> _(Healthcare Professional)_
