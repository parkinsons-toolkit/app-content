# Thinking and Remembering in Parkinson’s

Difficulties with thinking and memory are common in Parkinson’s and can be worrying for both the person affected and their loved ones. While some slowing of memory or thinking is normal with age, **larger changes that affect day-to-day activities are not normal** and should be discussed with a healthcare professional. Vocabulary and reading skills usually remain intact with age. Not all thinking and memory problems in Parkinson’s indicate dementia.

For more advanced symptoms, including dementia, see the **Progression of Symptoms** page.

## What Might Be Causing It?

Memory and thinking problems in Parkinson’s usually develop **gradually**. Common areas affected include:

- **Executive function**: Planning, keeping things in mind, flexible thinking, and self-control.  
  *Example*: Difficulty planning a meal so that all ingredients are ready at the right time.  

- **Attention**: Staying focused on tasks, conversations, or multi-tasking.  
  *Example*: Trouble following a conversation or reading.  

- **Language**: Remembering and understanding words.  
  *Example*: Forgetting words or not understanding complex discussions.  

- **Visuospatial function**: Judging distances, depth, imagining objects, or recognizing patterns.  
  *Example*: Getting off at the wrong bus stop or misjudging a step.  

- **Memory**: Recalling information or events.  
  *Example*: Repeating oneself or forgetting the plot of a TV program.

### Dementia and Other Causes
- **Dementia**: Gradual impairments in thinking, memory, and other brain functions affecting daily life. Parkinson’s can cause dementia, but not all memory problems lead to it.  
- **Other gradual causes**:  
  - Depression or anxiety  
  - Sleep disturbance  
  - Certain medications  
  - Hormone imbalances (e.g., hypothyroidism)  
  - Vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12 deficiency)  
  - Alcohol misuse  
  - Abnormal blood chemistry (e.g., high calcium or low sodium)  

### Sudden Changes: Delirium
- Sudden confusion or fluctuation in alertness may indicate **delirium**, a response to a new stress on the body.  
- Possible triggers: infections, medications, or abnormal blood chemistry (e.g., high/low blood sugar).  
- Delirium requires urgent assessment by a healthcare professional.

## What Should I Do?

- **Sudden changes in thinking or memory (hours or days)**: Seek urgent medical help.  
  - If mildly ill: contact your GP.  
  - If very ill: go to A&E.  

- **Gradual changes (weeks to months)**:  
  - If symptoms persist **>1 month** or affect daily life, make a non-urgent GP appointment.  
  - Discuss symptoms with your Parkinson’s specialist team.

## Self-Management Strategies

### Take Your Time
- Stress worsens thinking.  
- Allow extra time for tasks.

### Keep Well
- Sleep, physical health, and emotional wellbeing support memory and thinking.  
- See **Optimising Wellbeing** pages for more information.

### Prompts and Reminders
- **Lists**: To-do lists, reminders for items to take out, etc.  
- **Calendars/organisers**: Track appointments and birthdays.  
- **Clocks and alarms**: Prominent clocks or alarms to remind you about medication or tasks.  
- **Track events**: Record activities or symptoms using tools like the **Symptom & Activity Tracker**.

### Establish Routines
- Routines reduce cognitive load and make tasks more automatic.

### Social Support
- Engage friends or family to help with memory and attend appointments.  
- Maintain social and leisure activities to support cognitive function.  
- Consider **befriending services** through Parkinson’s UK or Age UK for regular contact with volunteers.
