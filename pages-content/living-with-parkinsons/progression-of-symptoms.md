# Progression of Symptoms

Progression of Symptoms
Introduction
Everyone’s experience of Parkinson’s is different. Just because some people
experience the symptoms described here does not mean that you will.
In general, over time people experience more symptoms, but there is no rule about
which symptoms or when. For some people, the uncertainty about how things will
look and feel in the future is one of the most difficult parts of the Parkinson’s
diagnosis.
Progression may involve the development of new symptoms or the worsening of
existing symptoms. It may include an increasing difficulty controlling symptoms.
Here we discuss challenges around progression and some of the more advanced
symptoms. For other symptoms see the Symptom Management pages.
Dealing with progression
- Long term health conditions, such as Parkinson’s, can cause different types of
loss: from loss of ability to do things you could did before, through to loss of
feeling good about yourself as a person.
- The sense of loss can go on for a long time, or occur repeatedly at different
times in Parkinson’s as the condition changes.
- Grief is a normal emotional response to any kind of loss.
- ‘Stages of grief’ have been described as including anger and denial. In reality
people do not necessarily follow through emotions in such distinct stages. You
may experience different emotions at different times, all driven by grief. This
can happen even long after you thought you had accepted the situation.
- Grief may also be affecting those around you.
- Sometimes grief can come before the loss. This is known as anticipatory grief.
This is where the grieving process occurs due to the expectation of what may
come.
What can be done?
It is normal to feel grief. It is helpful to acknowledge your grief. Understanding that
grief is normal may be a comfort, as is knowing that there is support around for

these feelings. Using the support around you to help you through this grieving
process is important.
- Talk to people involved in your life. Helping people close to you to understand
your view point will help them to support you more sensitively.
- Talk to people with personal experience of what you are going through.
Support groups can be very helpful, though they do not suit everyone. Support
groups can be face-to-face, online face- to-face, or online such as Twitter. They
can help you to feel less alone. Support groups can also help with the sharing
of tips for handling some of the challenges you may be facing.
- If you find your feelings are overwhelming, you could speak to your GP or
Parkinson’s specialist
team.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“The more I said, “Parkinson’s is doing this,” you may be more angry and
frustrated. But to be able to think that it’s a disease and I’m living with it
and I have to go and change my life around it, you sort of understand that
I have to accept that, because it’s not going to go away. It’s going to stay
there. So it’s better for me to deal with it like that.” (Person with
Parkinson’s)
Progression of symptoms
Variability of symptoms is common in Parkinson’s: good days and bad days; good hours
and bad hours. The progression of someone’s exact symptoms over time is impossible to
predict.
But generally, over time, symptoms tend to change:
- Symptoms may be quite mild for a period of time, and not impact one’s daily life
- Eventually, symptoms worsen and/or involve other areas of the body – for example, a
tremor of the right hand may eventually increase and/or also involve the right foot.
This can happen over many months or years, and may not follow this exact pattern.
- Earlier on, symptoms, particularly movement symptoms, tend to respond well to
medication.
- Over time you may experience that the medication ‘wears off’ more between doses.
- Involuntary movements, for example unintended twisting of the shoulders, can also
develop.
- Various changes to medication regime can be made in order to ease some of these
problems. Changes to the diet might also be suggested. This is also discussed on the
Variability of symptoms page.
- Over time, it becomes harder for people to mobilise, and falls and freezing are more
likely to occur
- In the more advanced stages of Parkinson’s, the fluctuations and variability in
symptoms can become less clearly related to the medication regime. The changes
between good and bad times can become abrupt and unpredictable.
- It is impossible for you or your health care professional to predict exactly how your
disease will
progress and over how much time, because each person’s course is different
What can be done?
Speak with your Parkinson’s specialist team:
- There may be adjustments to medication that could help, or the addition of new
medications.
- Depending on your circumstances, there may be other options, such as:
- Medication by injection, ‘apomorphine’ see Medication page.
- More invasive options such as Deep Brain Stimulation – see Advanced
& Surgical Treatments page.
- An operation to put a tube into your gut, so that medication can be
given directly into your digestive system – see Advanced & Surgical
Treatments page.
However, there may not be any suitable medical or surgical way to improve the
pattern of your condition. This means that adapting to deal with the unpredictable
symptoms may be required. Many find this hard.
If the symptoms are affecting your ability to undertake daily activities or tasks, then
you can speak to your GP. You can ask them to refer you to an Occupational
Therapist who may be able to recommend strategies, equipment or support to
help you deal with these difficulties.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

“I did try to keep a diary about the Parkinson’s. You know, Just to… because
I thought when I go back to the Parkinson’s clinic I could look back, and say
last week he was like this, you know.
It can help see changes, and get help.” (Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)
Dementia
- Not everyone with Parkinson’s gets dementia. It is more common in people who have
had
Parkinson’s for a long time, but it is difficult to predict who will develop it.
- The term Cognitive impairment includes a collection of difficulties. These include
difficulties with thinking, concentration, insight and memory. Some people have
difficulties in these areas but do not have dementia. When there are difficulties in
more than one of these areas and they affect daily life: that is dementia.
- Dementia is an umbrella term for a whole range of related conditions: Parkinson’s can
cause dementia, but this is different to other types of dementia that you may have
heard of, like Alzheimer’s or Vascular Dementia.
- Many people find the idea of dementia very scary. For this reason they avoid seeking
help for fear of it, but there are things that can be done to support you.
- Beware of misunderstandings: o Dementia is not just a condition of older or frailer
people.
- The loss of identity that is often portrayed of dementia in the media is
not always the case. It is actually less common in Parkinson’s Dementia.
- There is huge variation in symptoms in people. Dementia is sometimes related with
changes in behaviour (e.g. agitation), mood (e.g. depression) or perceptions (e.g.
hallucinations).
- As for Parkinson’s, a Dementia diagnosis can cause grief.
What can be done?
- See your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team for assessment. Assessments may be
conducted by a specialist service, often called a Memory Clinic.
- There are medication options that have been shown to improve symptoms in
dementia. These are generally started by a Parkinson’s specialist or a dementia
specialist.
- Memory clinic services vary by area. They will generally have support services
connected to them, or they can give you the details of services that can help you.
- Day-to-day strategies for memory difficulties are discussed on the Thinking &
Remembering page.
- Prepare: over time dementia can affect a person’s ability to make decisions. If
someone no longer has the ‘mental capacity’ to make decisions about their care, then
decisions will be made on their behalf. Prepare by thinking ahead and making your
wishes known. You can record your wishes in advance or appoint someone to take
decisions for you. See the Future Care Options for things to consider, and the Legal
Matters page for the formal process.
Swallowing problems & chest infections
- Swallowing problems are common in Parkinson’s but exist along a range of
severity.
- When swallowing problems are more severe, there is a risk of food, drink or
even saliva ‘going down the wrong way’. See extra information below for more
detail.
- From your mouth and nose there are two tubes going down into the body.
- The tube at the front is for air and goes down to the lungs.
- The tube at the back is for food and drink and goes down into the stomach.
- When it is all working well: When you swallow food or drink, your brain and body
carefully coordinate movements. This turns the food or drink into a ball, or bolus, closes
the entry to the air tube, and pushes the bolus down the tube into the stomach.
- When it is not working well, this coordination may be lost and food or drink may go ‘down
the wrong way’ into the air tube.
- Large solid pieces of food going down the wrong way can cause coughing and
choking. This can be very scary but it is the body reflex to clear the throat. The
cough itself is therefore good.
- Smaller solids or liquids going down the wrong way may reach the lungs. Here
they can cause a harmful reaction in the lungs, and sometimes infection, called
aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent debris and reaction in the lungs can cause
scarring of the lungs.
•
•
- Pneumonia refers to a type of chest (lung) infection. Symptoms may include
cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and fevers.
- In this context aspiration refers to food, drink or saliva going down the wrong
way, into the airway.
What can be done?
- Guidance for self-help strategies for less severe symptoms is on the Swallowing
Difficulties page.
- If you have not already done so, or if the situation has changed, talk to your GP
about referral to a Speech & Language Therapist (SLT) for a further assessment.
- If food or drink makes someone cough, encourage the cough to help clear the
food or drink from the airway.
- SLT’s may make recommendations. These may be changes in consistency of the
food and drink you take in. Such changes are to reduce the risk of aspiration
pneumonia.
- There are medical options that could be used for artificial feeding and
hydration. However, they do not remove the risk of saliva going down the
wrong way. Artificial feeding and hydration comes with risks and tube insertion
may be distressing.
- Some people prefer to accept the risk of food or drink going down the wrong
way, so continue to eat and drink by mouth.
- More information on artificial feeding is on the Future Care Options page.

Future Care Options
One of the hardest things about Parkinson’s and other long term health conditions,
is uncertainty; not knowing what the future will hold. Every person’s situation and
viewpoint is different. Awareness of the options, preparation and planning can be
empowering. Being prepared can help you feel a sense of control about the future.
