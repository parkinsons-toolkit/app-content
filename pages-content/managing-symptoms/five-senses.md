# 5 Senses

## Overview
- **Smell**: many people with Parkinson’s experience smell loss or reduced sense of smell.  
- **Taste**: closely linked with smell, some notice taste changes.  
- **Touch**: not directly affected by Parkinson’s, but peripheral neuropathy and increased pain/sensitivity may occur.  
- **Sight**: may include difficulty focusing, double vision, dry eyes, or changes in colour perception. Parkinson’s does not cause complete sight loss.  
- **Hearing**: mixed research results; hearing loss is mainly age-related.  

Sensory changes are important to identify for **safety reasons**, particularly if you drive.

## What might be causing it?

### Smell & Taste
- Can be directly affected by Parkinson’s  
- Other causes: smoking, infections (sinusitis, Covid-19), nasal polyps  

### Touch
- Pain and sensitivity may change with Parkinson’s medication (see *Pain* section)  
- **Peripheral neuropathy** can cause tingling, reduced sensation, or pain in hands/feet  
  - Causes include: diabetes, long-term alcohol use, vitamin B12 deficiency  
  - More common in people receiving *intraduodenal gel infusion (duodopa)*  
- Can also result from nerve damage or compression (injury, arthritis)  

### Sight
- Eye movement slowing → double vision  
- Reduced blinking → dry eyes, difficulty focusing  
- Eyelid spasms (blepharospasm) → involuntary eye closure  
- Low dopamine → duller or similar-looking colours  
- Parkinson’s medications may cause dry eyes  
- Other causes of vision changes: cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration  
- Parkinson’s does not usually cause sudden vision loss  

### Hearing
- Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is common  
- Parkinson’s may affect:  
  - Sound detection  
  - Processing multiple voices, especially when stressed or tired  
- Other causes: ear wax, infections, age-related decline

## What should I do about it?

- **Gradual changes**:  
  - Routine assessment (optician for sight, hearing test via GP or optician, GP for other changes)  
- **Sudden significant changes**: urgent medical assessment  
- Don’t assume changes are only due to age or Parkinson’s  
- **Driving**:  
  - Check DVLA vision standards  
  - Notify DVLA if you do not meet required standards

## What can I try for myself?

### If you have changes in smell and taste
- Maintain a healthy weight (see *Eating Well* and *Weight & Appetite Loss*)  
- Use textures to make food enjoyable  
- Be cautious of food past its best (check dates, label once opened)  
- Gas safety: service appliances regularly, consider gas detectors  
- Stop smoking  

### If you have changes in vision
- Regular eye checks with optician  
- Improve lighting; use night lights if vision is worse in dark  
- Large print or audio-books (libraries, RNIB)  
- Assistive technology (screen readers, talking clocks)  
- Over-the-counter eye drops/ointments for dry eyes (ask pharmacist)  
- Blink consciously to reduce eye dryness  
- Safety:  
  - Take care with sharp objects, road crossing  
  - Prevent falls (remove rugs, manage steps – see *Balance & Falls*)  
  - Follow DVLA guidance for driving  

### If you have changes in hearing
- Consider NHS or private hearing aids (smaller, better modern models)  
- Assistive technology: telecom devices, hearing loops, vibrating alarms, visual doorbells  
- Ensure you can hear alarms (or use visual alternatives)  

### If you have changes in touch
- Eat a varied diet to prevent deficiencies  
- Check skin regularly (especially hands and feet) for injuries  
- Be cautious with very hot or very cold objects (burn/frostbite risk)  

See *General Medical Advice* and *Reading, Writing & Technology* pages for additional tips.

## Further Assessment

### General questions you may be asked
- Onset: sudden (hours/days) or gradual (months/years)?  
- One-sided or both sides affected?  
- Triggers: what makes it worse/better?  
- Other new symptoms (sensory changes, weight loss, headaches, seizures, bladder/bowel changes)  
- Lifestyle (diet, smoking, alcohol)  
- How the problem affects daily life  

### Vision-specific questions
- Near vision (e.g. reading)  
- Distance vision (e.g. recognising people across the street)  
- One or both eyes affected? (check by covering one at a time)  
- Type of double vision: side-by-side or one above the other?  
- Other visual symptoms: flashing lights, floaters  
- Family history of eye conditions (e.g. glaucoma)  

## Further Assessment

### Hearing-specific questions
- Have others told you your hearing is bad, or that you have the TV/radio too loud?  
- What do you have trouble hearing? (e.g. difficulty in noisy places)  
- Do you experience ringing/buzzing in the ears (*tinnitus*) or spinning sensation (*vertigo*)?  
- Have you had significant exposure to loud noise (e.g. through work)?  

### Touch-specific questions
- Which parts of the body are affected?  
- Any history of injury related to the area?  
- Do you experience tingling, pins and needles, or pain in the affected area?  
- Any new muscle weakness?  

### Smell & Taste-specific questions
- Is it complete or partial loss, or altered sensation (e.g. metallic taste)?  
- Have you had a recent cold or flu-like symptoms?

## Tracking Symptoms

Use **My Tracker** in your manual:
- Helps you recall details of symptoms.  
- Useful if symptoms come and go → may reveal patterns (e.g. related to Parkinson’s medication).  
- Monitor over time; multiple recordings may be needed to identify trends.  

---

## Tests

Depending on assessment, your healthcare professional may suggest:
- Blood tests  
- Scans  
- Nerve function tests  

⚠️ There is no single test that identifies if a sensory problem is caused by Parkinson’s.  

---

## Further Treatments

Healthcare professionals may offer reassurance, advice, or treatments.

### Medication
- Only doctors (GP, neurologist) or specialist nurses should make changes.  
- Do **not** change medication yourself.  
- Adjusting Parkinson’s medication may help if symptoms are linked.  
- Medication may be switched if symptoms are a side effect (e.g. dry eyes from anticholinergics).  
- Special painkillers may be prescribed for nerve pain (peripheral neuropathy).  
- **Botox injections** may be considered for *blepharospasm* (eyelid spasms).  

### Referral
You may be referred to:
- **Audiology** → hearing problems  
- **Ophthalmology/Neuro-ophthalmology** → sight problems  
- **Specialist Neurology services** → Botox for blepharospasm  
- **ENT (Ear, Nose & Throat)** → smell or taste problems  
- **Other specialties** → for peripheral neuropathy, depending on suspected cause

## Key Messages
- Sensory changes (smell, taste, touch, sight, hearing) can be part of Parkinson’s, but may also have other causes.  
- Self-care strategies can ease the impact of sensory changes in daily life.  
- Always consider the **safety implications** of sensory changes.
