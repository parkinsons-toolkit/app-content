# Sleep Disturbances and Dreams in Parkinson’s

## Why Sleep Disturbances Happen in Parkinson’s

1. **Parkinson’s-related causes**
   - Altered dopamine levels affect sleep patterns and movements.
   - Difficulty moving in bed due to stiffness or rigidity.
   - REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (acting out dreams).

2. **Other contributing factors**
   - Urinary symptoms (night-time urination).  
   - Pain, cramps, or muscle spasms.  
   - Anxiety or low mood.  
   - Medications that affect sleep.  
   - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (pauses or loud snoring during sleep).

## Practical Strategies to Improve Sleep

### 1. Maintain a consistent routine
- Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily, even on weekends.
- Include relaxing pre-bed activities (warm bath, gentle massage, breathing exercises).

### 2. Optimize daytime activity
- Exercise during the day, but avoid vigorous exercise 2 hours before bedtime.

### 3. Manage the bedroom environment
- Keep the room quiet, dark, and comfortably cool (16–18°C).  
- Avoid using the bedroom for TV or work.
- Consider eye masks or earplugs if needed.

### 4. Bed and clothing tips
- Nylon or satin sheets and lightweight bed covers can make movement easier.
- Avoid both satin pajamas and satin sheets at the same time—they may slide too much.
- Maintain some friction areas at bed edges for grip.

### 5. Pre-bed habits
- Empty your bladder before sleeping.  
- Limit caffeine (4 hours before bed) and alcohol.  
- Avoid large meals right before sleep (allow 2–3 hours for digestion).  
- Minimize screen time before bed (TV, phone, tablet).  
- Avoid lying awake for long periods—get up if you can’t sleep.  
- Limit daytime naps to ~20 minutes if needed.

## When to Seek Professional Help

- **Severe sleep disruption**: If violent movements, frequent waking, or distressing dreams occur.
- **Signs of sleep apnea**: Pauses in breathing, choking, gasping, loud snoring.
- **Persistent poor sleep**: After 1 month of self-management strategies.

## Professional Assessment

- **Questions your clinician may ask**:
  - Sleep patterns, triggers, and associated symptoms (pain, RLS, urinary issues).  
  - Bed partner observations (snoring, breathing pauses, movements).  
  - Medication timing and effects.  
  - Daytime impact (mood, concentration, balance).

- **Tests**:
  - Usually not needed, but sometimes a sleep study may be recommended.

---

## Medication Options

- **May help**:
  - Optimized Parkinson’s meds (Levodopa, dopamine agonists).  
  - Slow-release forms or patches for overnight coverage.  
  - Melatonin, clonazepam (for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder).  

- **May worsen sleep**:
  - Amantadine, Selegiline, high-dose Levodopa, some dopamine agonists.  
  - Opiates, SSRIs, ephedrine.

---

## Tracking Symptoms

- Use a sleep diary to record:
  - Bedtime/wake time  
  - Night-time awakenings  
  - Medication timing  
  - Other symptoms (pain, cramps, urinary needs)  
  - Partner observations (if possible)

---

## Key Takeaways

- Parkinson’s affects sleep via dopamine changes, movement difficulties, and other symptoms.  
- Lifestyle and environmental adjustments can help improve sleep.  
- Medications may need optimization but never change them without professional guidance.  
- Severe or persistent sleep problems should be discussed with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist.

## Dream Disturbances in Parkinson’s

Many people with Parkinson’s experience vivid dreams. For some, this is harmless, but it can cause distress or disrupt sleep for others, impacting daytime functioning. Movement changes during dreams are also common in Parkinson’s.

### REM Sleep and Dream Acting

- Dreams occur during **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep**. During this phase, the body normally does not move.  
- **REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD)** occurs when this paralysis is lost, causing people to "act out" their dreams.  
- Movements can range from gesturing, jerking, and talking to thrashing, shouting, or walking.  
- RBD is closely linked to Parkinson’s, though not everyone with Parkinson’s has RBD, and not all people with RBD have Parkinson’s.

### Causes and Contributing Factors

- **Directly from Parkinson’s**: Most vivid dreams and RBD in Parkinson’s are caused by the condition itself.  
- **Other factors that worsen vivid dreams**:
  - Certain medications  
  - Stress, trauma, anxiety  
  - Changes to sleep schedule (e.g., jetlag)  
  - Insomnia  
  - Alcohol or illicit drug use, or withdrawal  
- **More common in**:
  - People with some mental health conditions (e.g., depression, schizophrenia)  
  - Those with other sleep disorders (e.g., narcolepsy)  
  - People with other physical illnesses (e.g., heart disease)  
  - Early pregnancy

### Safety Considerations

- Assess **risk of injury** to self or bed partner.  
- Features requiring urgent attention:
  - Violent movements  
  - Falling from bed  
  - Walking beyond the bed-space  
- Contact your **Parkinson’s specialist team** if urgent, or discuss with your GP if less severe.

---

## Further Assessment

- Healthcare professionals may ask about:
  - Sleep patterns and disturbances  
  - Medication timing and effects  
  - Bed partner observations  
  - Daytime impact on mood and concentration

# Tracking and Managing Dream Disturbances in Parkinson’s

## What to Track

When preparing to discuss dream disturbances with your healthcare professional, consider tracking the following:

- **Type of disturbance**: What exactly are you experiencing?  
- **Sleep pattern**: Bedtime, wake time, night-time awakenings.  
- **Lifestyle factors**: Exercise, diet, caffeine/alcohol intake, stress levels.  
- **Mood and other symptoms**: Anxiety, depression, hallucinations, or other neurological symptoms.  
- **Risks and impacts**: Falling out of bed, injury risk, impact on daily functioning.  
- **Medication**: Timing, dose, and type of medications.

### Using a Symptom and Activity Tracker

- Helps recall details accurately for healthcare consultations.  
- For dream disturbances, track:
  - Sleep pattern  
  - Timing of dream problems  
  - Medication schedule  
- Monitor **at least three occasions** to identify patterns.

---

## Tests

- Usually **not needed**.  
- Sometimes a **sleep study** may be recommended, which could involve a short hospital stay for monitoring sleep.

---

## Further Treatments

- After consultation, healthcare professionals may offer:
  - Reassurance  
  - Advice on lifestyle or safety measures  
  - Medication adjustments if appropriate  

### Medication Options

**May be prescribed for dream disturbances:**
- Clonazepam  
- Melatonin  

**Medications that may worsen RBD:**
- Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications (e.g., mirtazapine, SSRIs such as citalopram or sertraline)  
- Always discuss any changes with your healthcare professional—do **not** alter medication on your own.

---

## Key Messages

- Vivid dreams, calling out, or acting out dreams are common in Parkinson’s.  
- Safety is paramount—address any risks to yourself or others.  
- Consult your **Parkinson’s specialist team** if you experience these symptoms.
