Guidance for Families and Carers
If a loved one is told that they have Parkinson’s it is an adjustment for you both.
Whether you are reading this following a recent diagnosis or after they have had
•
•
Parkinson’s for a while, we hope this section will provide useful information on
how to support the person with Parkinson’s by supporting yourself.
We know Parkinson’s is
progressive and a complex
condition. This means that
your role and involvement
will change over time and
there will be different
challenges along the way.
Everyone’s journey is
unique and will depend on
your personal situation. It will also depend on your relationship to that person
(partner, sister, brother, child or friend). You are likely to experience a range of
emotions,
which is normal and expected. Supporting a loved one with Parkinson’s can be a
rewarding experience. There will also be more difficult experiences. These may
cause you to have challenging feelings to cope with, such as:
- Feeling anxious or worried about the future
- Feelings of anger
- Feelings of guilt
- Feeling stressed, often showing itself as physical symptoms such as
“Butterflies” in the stomach or difficulty sleeping
- Depression, despair or feelings of hopelessness
- Feeling trapped
- Feeling lost/lonely
- Feeling isolated
These feelings are all normal and very common. In fact, they are so common that
a recent report published by the Mental Health Foundation stated that:
- 71% of people of those studied, and classified as ‘carers’ have poor physical or
mental health
- 84% of those studied feel more stressed, 78% feel more anxious and 55%
reported depression as a result of their caring role
- 38% of young carers report having a mental health problem, yet only half
report receiving additional support from a member of staff at school
It is vitally important to be aware of this and take steps to look after yourself.
While negative, challenging emotions can be part of caring for someone with
Parkinson’s, it is important not to become overwhelmed by them. To prevent
these unhelpful and challenging emotions escalating, there are many things you
can do to help and look after yourself. It is also important where possible to accept
help and support.
This means it is not just what you can do on your own (that is, using your own
internal resources such as skills, and abilities: your resilience). It is also what you
can do with support. That is what makes the most of your ability to cope with any
situation.
This means not only seeking support when you experience unhelpful and
challenging emotions, or begin to feel overwhelmed by them. It is also finding
support from the start that can help to prevent any unhelpful/challenging
emotions from escalating.
Looking after your general wellbeing
As well as reacting to challenging emotions when they arise, it is also important to
be proactive, i.e. to look ahead so you can be in more control when dealing with
challenging emotions. Looking ahead and putting strategies and practical things in
place can be of help when juggling multiple commitments. This will help you to be
in a better place to cope with the demands of being a carer. It could also prevent
stress or burnout as much as possible. You can improve your mental wellbeing and
resilience, i.e. your ability to cope, in a number of ways.
Tips for looking after your
general wellbeing:
- Try to connect with others
- Exercise regularly (in a way that fits in
with your situation)
- Eat as well as you can
- Try to get enough sleep
- Try to engage in
hobbies and interests (in a
way that fits in with your situation, even 5 minute blocks throughout the day
can have a benefit)
•
•
- Reframe unhelpful/challenging thoughts/emotions. That is, to think about
things differently
- As well as planning ahead, try to be in the present during your day-to-day
activities
While many carers are selfless in what they do, it is important to remember that
you are also important. It is good to try to consider what your own needs are for
your best health, self-care and support. The advice on airplanes to “put your own
oxygen mask on first” is also true for carers. Your physical, medical and emotional
needs are as important as those of the person with Parkinson’s. Doing what you
can to look after yourself is essential to help you be in the best place to support
them and yourself.
Please see the Finances page for information about financial support that may help
you look after your own wellbeing too. Also the Complementary therapy pages for
information of activities you may like to try for your wellbeing.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“for anyone that is a carer, they must have something for themselves, either
exercise or going out for coffee with friends. You have to do that ... when
I’ve been out, he’ll say, how was the class? and I’ll say, ‘oh, I’m exhausted’.
and then you’ve got things to talk about” (Carer of someone with
Parkinson’s)
Coping with stress
Stress is something we all encounter. Life changes, such as personal problems,
relationship difficulties, pressures at work or moving to a new house, can all cause
stress. A certain level of stress can be good for the body: it is motivating and alerts
the mind. However, if stress becomes overwhelming or goes on for a long time, it
can take its toll both physically and emotionally. In supporting someone with
Parkinson’s, it is likely you will be exposed to many more things that cause you
stress. It is important to be aware of the signs of stress and address them where
possible.
Signs of stress
You may experience some of these physical symptoms:
- Chest pains/high blood pressure
- Breathlessness
- Headache/dizziness/fainting
- Sweating
- Constant tiredness
- Difficulty sleeping
- Changes in appetite
- Muscle pain
You may experience thoughts and difficult emotions, such as:
- Feeling that things are out of control
- Fearing that you are physically ill
- Fearing failure
- Being aggressive, irritable or edgy
- Feeling depressed
- Losing your sense of humour
- Feeling helpless
- Feeling lost/lonely
- Feeling tearful
How you may behave differently:
- Difficulty making decisions
- Inability to concentrate
- Avoiding difficult or social situations
- Being more tearful
- Being unable to show your true feelings
- No longer feeling able to speak with friends/family about your situation
To overcome stress or prevent too much stress, there are lots of practical steps you
can take. At heart of this is looking after yourself and your wellbeing.
Tips for coping with stress
- Identify triggers. Try to identify the things that you find stressful. This varies from
person to person and their situation. Once you are aware of what may be your
triggers, (that is the things that make you feel stressed), you can then find ways that
may be able to address them. Sometimes it is not possible to address what is stressing
you, but recognising this can reduce stress in itself.
•
•
- Take regular breaks. Supporting someone with Parkinson’s can be demanding. It is
important that you try and take regular breaks. Whether this be a few minutes each
hour (just to close your eyes and breathe), a few hours a day to yourself, or a weekend
away. Please see the Finances page for information about financial support that may
help you look after your own wellbeing in this way. If you are able to draw in support
to do this, it can be an added part of maintaining your wellbeing. Support groups may
be of help, and online resources and support can be a helpful way of taking a break.

- Get organised. Being a carer means there are additional responsibilities and
considerations to hold in mind. Try to stay on top of these by being as organised as
possible. Make a list of jobs and tackle one task at a time, and do not be afraid to ask
for support. Vary the jobs, using the interesting ones as a reward for getting through
the dull ones. When you have lots of demands, think about the level of importance
for each job.
A good way to remember is the four Ds of time management:
- DO! o DITCH! o DELEGATE!
- DELAY!
- Reassess what is important. When a significant event occurs, like a diagnosis
of Parkinson’s, it is normal to go through a process of thinking about what is
important in life. You may also be forced to think about what you can manage
with the resources you have. It is important to give yourself time to think
these through together with the person with Parkinson’s.
- What is important now? o What is necessary? o What is it that's
giving you too much stress? o What can you change?
- Can you work towards a better balance in your life, including what
is important to you?
- Who can I call?
- Confide in someone. Do not keep stress bottled up. Even if there is nothing
anyone can do about the stress, sharing how you are feeling with someone
you trust can be helpful. This can take many formats, including online groups
and resources. It can also let people know they need to keep you in mind and
ask how you are. This can make a big difference. For some keeping a journal
can be a helpful way of recording and releasing stresses and concerns.
While there are positive steps you can think about taking, there are also some traps
it is helpful to try to avoid:
- Being hard on yourself. Being hard on yourself can be motivating in small
doses, but doing it too much has the opposite effect. Often carers are self-
critical because they want to do better or feel they should be doing more.
Sometimes a comment from someone can trigger these negative thoughts. It
can be helpful to remember that they are not you and do not live in your
situation. Being self-critical is understandable as it generally comes from a
good and caring place. You want to do the best for your loved one/friend. It is
important to remember that there are limits to what you can do. A helpful
concept to remember is being “good enough”. It is helpful to remember all
the things you are doing rather than some of the things you feel you are not.
Thinking about the negatives is only likely to add to your stress. If you notice
you are being self- critical, helpful questions to ask are “how is the way I am
acting towards myself helping me move towards what I am aiming for?” Often
when we are being hard on ourselves, it leads to us feeling less motivated.
•
•
This in turn means we are less likely to achieve our goals. Instead, we could
ask “if this was a friend in the same situation what would I be saying to them?”
This is especially important when you have comments you feel are negative
or judgmental from other people.
- Not communicating your needs. People will often offer help, but sometimes
it might not be the right help. Also, the help you need may change over time.
This can be as stressful as people not helping. However, it is important to
remember people are not mind-readers. They often do not know what help is
needed or what is most important to you. Do not be afraid to let people know
your needs and to be specific. Equally, allow others room for error. They are
unlikely to do things as well as you, but they need the chance to practise (and
remember the concept of good enough).
- Not being assertive. Being a carer means you will often have many additional
demands on you. Therefore, it is important that you are assertive when you
need to be. This can be when others put additional demands on you or when
it comes to stating your own needs. Being assertive is stating your needs
clearly and why they are important to you.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“If you can cope with one day at a time, it’s less stress, …. just concentrate
on today. It works. Less stress for me, less stress for him. …. I’ll say to
anybody’ take one day at a time. It’s less stress’. I think if you take the stress
away you can cope” (Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)
Coping with low mood and depression
Everyone experiences low mood from time to time.
When this becomes persistent and interferes with
your life, then it may be diagnosed as depression.
Depressive feelings are very common and typically
follow a loss, such as bereavement, divorce or job
loss. Usually this is temporary and something we
can recover from naturally. Occasionally we may
need additional support.
Caring for someone with Parkinson’s can put you at
risk of depression. This is because you may be
exposed to more losses and more things you find
stressful. Also you may not be able to do the
activities that can keep low mood and depression at bay. It is important to
appreciate the effects of depression are very real and can really
interfere with your caring role. Depression can build up gradually, so you may not
realise how much it is affecting you. Knowing what the symptoms are, who you
should talk to and what treatments are available, can help you deal with
depression quickly.
Signs of depression
Depression is when we feel low or sad, and can’t find any pleasure in life. Many of
us feel like this sometimes, but depression is when these feelings last longer and
are more extreme.
Other symptoms of depression include:
- Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, worried or tearful.
- Feeling unable to cope with everyday things that you would not have thought
twice about in the past.
- Losing your appetite, losing weight and/or having trouble sleeping.
- In extreme cases you might even think about harming yourself or other
people.
If you see any of these symptoms in yourself, you may be affected by depression.
It's important to seek help from a GP or your Parkinson’s nurse if you think you
may be depressed. Don’t ever feel that you are a failure for needing help with
depression. Also don’t ever feel that you are being judged or that you seeking help
puts the welfare of the person with Parkinson’s at risk. Medical professionals are
fully aware of the pressures of caring for someone. Many people wait a long time
before seeking help, but the sooner you do so, the sooner help can be put into
place. Treatment for depression can involve self-help strategies, lifestyle changes,
talking therapies and/or medicine. Most people benefit from a combination of
these. The treatment will depend on the difficulties and symptoms you have.
Tips for coping with low mood and depression:
•
•
- Regular exercise
- Eating healthily
- Sleeping well
- Talking with friends, family, support
groups
- Doing things that you enjoy doing,
e.g. listening to music
- Doing things that give you a sense of
purpose and meaning, e.g. work,
volunteering
- Avoiding alcohol
## My Experience

“Count your blessings. What you’ve got today, make the most of." (Carer of
someone with
Parkinson’s)
Coping with anxiety
Anxiety is a very normal emotion; it is our response to threat. For humans, threat
can come in many different forms: physical, emotional or social. The threat can be
in the here and now, in the past or in the future. At a biological level, when a threat
is detected, adrenaline is rushed into our bloodstream. This helps us to run away
from the threat. We have a well-developed threat system. This means this
fight/flight response happens whether the danger is real, or when we think there
is danger even if there is none. It is the body's alarm and way of surviving. It is
what keeps us safe.
Like most emotional problems, caring for someone with Parkinson’s means that
you are at increased risk of developing anxiety. Typically, this is experienced as
anxiety or worry about lots of different things. Carers can also experience acute
attacks of anxiety (panic attacks). They can also have anxiety that occurs in certain
situations, for example feeling really anxious about social activities.
Signs of anxiety
Anxiety can be experienced in different ways. It might affect how you feel physically,
mentally and/or how you behave. Symptoms include:
- Increased heart rate and palpitations (rapid fluttering in the chest, or pounding
sensation in the chest)
- Feeling hot and sweaty
- Pins and needles
- Light headed or dizziness
- Muscular tension
- “Butterflies” in the stomach
- Breathing faster and more shallow
- Problems concentrating
- Feeling wary or on edge all the time
- Actively avoiding things or not going out
- Feeling unable to cope or overwhelmed
If you recognise any of these symptoms in yourself, you may be affected by anxiety.
It's important to seek help from a GP or your Parkinson’s nurse if you think are
struggling with anxiety. Treatment for anxiety can involve self-help strategies,
lifestyle changes, talking therapies and/or medicine. Most people benefit from a
combination of these. Treatment will depend on the difficulties and symptoms that
you have.
Tips for coping with anxiety
- Regular exercise
- Eating a healthy diet
- Getting enough sleep
- Talking with friends, family, support groups
- Using relaxation techniques
- Using controlled breathing
Coping with uncertainty
A common source of stress and anxiety for the person with Parkinson’s and their
loved ones is uncertainty around the future. We all feel more comfortable when
we have certainty in our life and Parkinson’s can be unpredictable. Over time, the
Parkinson’s will progress, but no one is able to predict how or when. Even day-to-
•
•
day symptoms can vary a great deal. It is natural to try to prepare for these
changes, but trying to prepare for everything that might happen is impossible.
Tips for coping with uncertainty
- Continue to plan. Do not let uncertainty around the future stop you from
planning things that are important to you. It is important to have something
to look forward to that can give you some feeling of control.
- Be flexible. The most effective approach to uncertainty is to be flexible. Think
of this like a tree that bends with the wind. Try not to rely on just one plan as
this can make it more difficult to adjust. It can also leave you unprepared if
that plan fails. By having a few different options, or having belief that you can
manage in the moment, allows you to feel more secure about the changes
that may or may not happen. You can increase flexibility by drawing on
support from those around you, if you have such support. Also, getting
information and numbers of support systems for such time as when you may
need it.
- Get knowledge. Having the
right knowledge at the right time
can help you cope with
uncertainty. If there is something
you are worrying about, usually
someone else has worried about
it too. They might have thought of
something that can help.
However, it is important not to
get too far ahead as not everything you worry about will happen. Parkinson’s
affects everyone very differently.
- Worry versus problem solving. Know the difference between worry and
problem solving: they are not the same thing. Ask yourself, “has it happened
yet?” and “is there anything I can do about it?” If the answer is no, then it is
likely that you are worrying, as it is a hypothetical concern you are trying to
address or there is nothing you can do. If the answer is yes, then put what is
needed into action and then ask the question again.
- Share. Talking through things with someone you trust can be helpful. When
you hold problems in your mind they can become bigger. They can become
harder to think through, or can be joined by other problems. Sometimes
worry about the future cannot be solved, but talking about it can help. Talking
can help you to develop different viewpoints or simply release emotional
tension. For some people keeping a journal can be as helpful talking to
someone. It can be therapeutic to write down thoughts and fears into a book
that can be closed to give ‘headspace’. Sometimes the process of writing it
down and reading it back at a later date can help see solutions that it was not
possible to see otherwise.
- Develop a good support network. Worry often escalates when you
underestimate your ability to cope with things. You can help yourself feel
more secure and able to cope with the future no matter how uncertain it may
seem by strengthening your relationships. Also strengthening other resources
you can draw upon.
- Trying to enjoy the here and now. It is understandable to be concerned about
the future and it is sensible to think through some of your concerns. However,
do not let these distract you from making the most out of the here and now.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
"we try to not let it rule our lives" (Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)
“the advice I would give to people is that you prepare yourself a schedule of
things that you should be doing for and with that person during your day.
And where it varies, you mark it up and vary it as …but unless you write it
down and give yourself something to work to, you can, you can go wrong."
(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)
Coping with guilt
Guilt is one of the most common emotions experienced by people supporting
those with Parkinson’s. There can be many things to feel guilty about. There are no
simple ways to get around this. You may feel that you should be doing more. You
may feel that you should be doing something better in your caring role. It may be
that you think you should not complain about anything because the person with
Parkinson’s is worse off than you. It may be that you are doing something the
person with Parkinson’s would like to do, but cannot. However, the fact you feel
guilty probably reflects that you a good carer. It is important to not let guilt, or
comments from others, act as a barrier to looking after yourself. It is also important
that guilt does not stop you expressing your feelings in some way or if you are in a
position to, talking with the person you care for.
Tips for managing guilt:
•
•
- Do not compare. You may not be the person with Parkinson’s, but that does
not mean your feelings do not count. Your life has also changed as a result of
the diagnosis and it is important that your feelings are acknowledged and
heard.
- Do not get trapped in a cycle of resentment and guilt. It is OK to feel resentful,
angry, hurt, etc. You may resent the world (that your life has changed). You may
resent others (that theirs has not changed or that they are not as supportive or
helpful as you feel you need). You may even resent the person with Parkinson’s
(that they do not recognise/appreciate what you do). You may then feel guilty
about having these feelings. Remember it is normal to feel a range of emotions.
It is important not to push these emotions away. Instead it is better to work
through them, that is to look at them, understand them and find ways of
managing them
- Talk it through. Guilt can be a
difficult emotion to talk about, but
it is important that you do.
- If you can, talk to the person you care
for. Remember that in some situations
the person you are caring for may also
feel guilty. It is possible they feel guilty
about being a "burden" or the effect
caring has on you. By talking guilt
through, you can each let each other
know how you are feeling and think of
ways you can support one other. If you can’t talk to each other, then think
about the support groups available. It may be that you both find it easier
to share your trues thoughts and fears with people outside of your
immediate circle.
- If you are able to, talk to your friends and family. Let them know how you
are feeling and ask them for their support and help.
- Talk to other carers. They will be familiar with what you are going through.
They may be able to suggest solutions that have worked for them that you
might like to try. Perhaps you can contact a local carers or Parkinson’s
group. Perhaps you know someone else who is a carer (this does not have
to be for someone with Parkinson’s).
- Talk online/telephone. People often find it helpful to talk to people who
don't know them when sharing feelings of guilt. Online groups or forums
can be helpful in these situations. There are also charities you can call for
free where you can talk your thoughts through, especially if you suddenly
feel overwhelmed by them, for example the Samaritans.
Talk to your GP. They may be able to refer you to a counselling service, or give you
information about local support groups. You can also self-refer to some services in
some locations. Details of psychological services (IAPT) can be found on the NHS
website.
Coping with loss and grief
While it can be difficult, it is important that you acknowledge the losses you
experience when supporting someone with Parkinson’s. Experiencing these losses
can be thought of as a grieving process. In Parkinson’s, there can be different
losses that occur at different times and stages. Therefore, the grieving process can
be ongoing or repeating. It can be helpful to think about the different stages of
grief. When do this it is important to remember that not everyone experiences all
of the stages, or goes through them in this order:
•
•
Tips for coping with loss and grief
- Recognise the losses. It is important to acknowledge that the size and impact
of each loss will be personal to you. This will depend on what is important to
you. There is no relationship between what is visibly lost and how you should
feel.
- Seek and accept support. It can be important to talk about the losses in order
to understand them. Speak to family members or friends, or trained
counsellors if it is too hard to discuss with people close to you. Remember you
can also speak to the person with Parkinson’s. Many of the losses will be shared
and you can look at this together.
- Speak to others in a similar situation. It can be really helpful to speak to
someone who you know will understand exactly what it is you are going
through. They may give you some ideas on how to cope. It will also remind you
that you are not alone. Local support groups can be a good place to find others
who are in similar situations.
- Express your grief. Grief cannot stay hidden deep within you, so it is good try
to acknowledge and express your feelings. If talking to someone feels too
much, then find other ways to express your feelings. This could be through
music, art, exercise or writing a personal journal.
Accepting help
We know there can always be situations where asking for and accepting help can
be difficult, but is essential. It is important that if you can, you let those around
you know what your needs are. This will help them support you in the most
effective way. Having a list of numbers/email addresses/websites for support
groups/systems can help you feel secure in the knowledge you have access to
support when you need it.
Tips for accepting help
Ask for help. Your friends, family and others around you may be glad to be told
how they can help. If they are unable or unwilling to help, it will be useful to know
this when planning your sources of support. Remember, if you are not in a
situation to ask, having that list of numbers/email addresses/websites for support
groups/systems can help you know you are not alone.
- Guide help. If people do help, but give the wrong help, talk to them about this.
Gently guide them on what would be useful and how to give you the right sort
of help. This might differ from person to person. The help you need might be
a listening ear, or it might be something more practical. Being clear about
what you need from each helper will allow you to build a more effective
support network. Remember, you can always contact/talk to an independent
source outside of your immediate circle.
Refusal of help. Sometimes people with Parkinson’s may choose not to accept the
support offered. There may be many reasons for this. It is important that you talk
to the person about this. What help are they willing to accept? What do they not
want? These conversations can help both of you define your roles better and be
clear about what is expected of the other. Sometimes it may be that the person
with Parkinson’s is suffering emotionally. If you suspect this is the case, you could
encourage them to get some support. Remember, if you are not in a situation to
be able to talk with the person with Parkinson’s /or other family members, you
can contact one of the support groups which may help you know you are not
alone.
Coping with changes in relationships
Any long-term condition or disability is likely to have a big impact on even the
healthiest of relationships. Parkinson’s can cause many different changes to your
relationship. For some couples, coping with Parkinson's together has made their
relationships stronger. For others, it can have negative effects. These changes can
happen at any stage of the condition.
When someone has Parkinson’s, it’s common for relationship roles and dynamics to
change. As symptoms progress, the balance of roles may change and you may feel
increasingly like a carer. This can be difficult if your relationship was very different before.
For instance if the other person was the main provider or if you had an independent
lifestyle.
It is important to recognise that this can be a difficult transition. It is not a role you
suddenly adjust to overnight, but one that you will gradually grow into. However,
many carers and especially partners do not want to be seen as “carers”. While
there can be an expectation to provide care it is important not to become “just a
carer”.
Tips for coping with changes in relationships
- Try to keep doing the things you enjoy doing together
- Define what you are willing and not willing to do as a carer
- Ask the person with Parkinson’s what they are willing or not willing to allow
you to help with
•
•
- Keep talking
Coping with changes in sexual relationships
Although many people with Parkinson’s experience changes in their sexual
relationships, many others do not. Some describe problems that are actually
caused by age rather than Parkinson’s. Sexual relationships change naturally over
our lifetime, but Parkinson’s may mean you have to think about issues ahead of
time.
A few ways Parkinson’s can affect sexual relationships are:
- Tremor, stiffness or rigidity, and/or slowness of movement affecting sexual
performance.
- Fatigue affecting the time of day when it is most convenient to be intimate.
- Bladder or bowel symptoms causing anxiety around sexual performance, with
fears of incontinence.
- Medication side-effects causing changes in sex drive. Some Parkinson’s
medications can cause increased sex drive, alongside other impulsive
behaviours, such as compulsive gambling or reckless spending. This may be
experienced by the partner as more frequent demands for intimacy or changes
in sexual preference that may make the partner uncomfortable. In contrast,
some medications, such as antidepressants, can suppress sex drive and
arousal.
- Mood changes in themselves can affect sex drive. Depression often results in a
loss of sex drive.
- Changes in confidence and self-esteem can affect sex drive. People may feel
less attractive or less able sexually.
- As a carer, you may worry about placing demands on the person for sex or
worried that it may cause harm in some way.
- If you have never been comfortable talking about sex, any of these problems
may make it even harder for you and you might begin to avoid sex altogether.
Tips for coping with changes in sexual relationships
- Think about altering what you do together to take account of changing physical
abilities
- Make sure medications are at their most effective to reduce the interference
from any symptoms
- Find different ways to be intimate with each other
- Maintain a good relationship outside of sex
- Speak to your health professionals if concerned. This is particularly important
if there are issues with increased sex drive, because this can escalate if left
unchecked
- Consider talking to your GP or Parkinson’s nurse about medications if you are
concerned
about any of the physical aspects (e.g. incontinence or erectile dysfunction)
Coping with later stages of Parkinson’s
As Parkinson’s progresses, it can cause greater disability and have more of an
impact on everyday life. In addition, it can sometimes cause other health problems
such as infections. This all means that you may have more to do to care for the
person with Parkinson’s. This can affect your life in many ways.
- Emotionally. It is
normal to experience lots
of different emotions
about the caring role,
particularly as needs
become greater. Carers
can feel stressed and
overwhelmed, having little
time for themselves or
their own needs. Carers
may also feel isolated,
seeing friends and family less often/friends not contacting them much
anymore or no longer contacting them. Naturally, this can cause you to
feel sad, frustrated or isolated. If you
are feeling like this, remember these feeling are understandable. It is also still good
to talk to others about how you are feeling.
- Physically. It is important that you look after your own health just as
much as that of the person you are caring for. As well as any regular
check-ups and screenings, you should also try to make sure you give
yourself that little window of time for relaxation, eating well and
exercising.
- Work. Juggling working and caring can be very difficult. You have a legal
right to request flexible working to help you manage your added
•

responsibilities. Flexible working may involve working compressed
hours, different work hours, working from home or a different site, or
working part- time. You also have the right to take time off in an
emergency. Further information can be found on the GOV.UK website,
or www.carersuk.org
- Finances. Caring can have an impact on your finances. This is especially
if you have had to give up work in order to support someone. As a carer,
you are entitled to a Carer’s Assessment from your local social services
team. This will assess if you are eligible for any extra support, including
financial assistance. Please see the Finance page for further
information.
- Transport. If you or your passenger has severe mobility problems, you
may be allowed to apply for a Blue Badge. This means you are free from
some parking restrictions and have access to selected parking spaces.
There may however be additional restrictions in your borough. Check
the GOV.UK website: www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge. Your local
authority may also offer additional reduced fare schemes for people
with disabilities. For example, in London, the Freedom Pass lets older
and people with disabilities to use London buses, tubes and trains for
free. Day centres and clubs can also help with transport in some cases,
so you don’t have to arrange this yourself. See the Travel page for more
information.
Coping with changes in thinking and behaviour
As well as physical changes, there may also be changes in thinking abilities. There
may also sometimes be the development of hallucinations and delusions.
- Changes in thinking abilities. In later stages of Parkinson’s, there can be greater
difficulty with memory, concentration and speed of thinking. These can cause
confusion. When these difficulties are particularly marked, you may hear this referred
to as Parkinson’s dementia. See Thinking and Remembering for more information.
- Hallucinations. It is common for people with Parkinson’s to experience changes in
their visual abilities. They might describe visual illusions. This is when something that
is real looks different; for example, the tree outside might look like a person, or the
carpet pattern looks like it’s moving. In the later stages, the person with Parkinson’s
may also develop hallucinations. These are usually visual, which is seeing things that
are not there. There can also be hallucinations of sounds, smells, tastes and touch.
Usually, these are not distressing, and need no treatment. If they do become
distressing, they can be treated with medication. It is also possible that these
symptoms are caused by other medical conditions. They can also be a side-effect of
medications.
It is therefore important that your doctor knows.
- Delusions. Less commonly, people can develop delusions, becoming committed to a
thought or belief that isn’t true. This can include paranoia or suspiciousness, jealousy
within loving relationships, or believing they have special powers. If these occur, these
symptoms can be treated with medications.
Tips for coping with changes in thinking and behaviour
- Allow the person extra time to complete tasks
- Try not to rush or overload them, or distract them when they are doing a task
- Repeat any important information
- Keep a diary/timetable with the week’s important events or appointments in a central
place
- Keep a note-pad and pen by the phone
- Keep to a daily routine, with the same time for meals and bedtime as much as possible
- Avoid unfamiliar or confusing environments
- Use a nightlight or low level lighting at night-time to reduce any confusion
Coping with the future
As care needs increase, you and the person with Parkinson’s may wish to consider
what extra support you might be able to apply for:
- You are entitled to a Carer’s Assessment from your local social services team.
Following this, you may be able to apply for home care services. This includes
formal carers, or funds for managing the care needs yourself.
- Social services may suggest using telecare/assistive technology. This may
include such items as portable alarms, which can help if there is a risk of falling.
- Social services can give you information about local day centres, lunch clubs
and exercise groups. Some of these would be open to you both. This can help
you both keep socially and physically active. Some will be for the person with
Parkinson’s only. This would allow you to have a break and do something for
yourself. Social services can arrange respite breaks. These might be residential,
when the person with Parkinson’s stays in a care home or hospital. They might
be home-based instead. This is when someone stays with the person with
Parkinson’s in their own home whilst you take a break.
- Social services can also advise on residential care options, should care needs
become too difficult to manage at home. These can include extra-care
sheltered housing, which enables independent living with support close at
•
•
hand. Otherwise 24-hour care is available in a residential or nursing home.
Social services will be able to advise on the financial aspects of this.
You might want to plan for the future, sometimes known as advance care planning. This
could involve making Lasting Power of Attorney, Advance Decisions and preparing for end
of life.
- Lasting Power of Attorney. LPA is a legal document that lets someone appoint
another person(s) to help make decisions on their behalf. This can be important
to have in place, should the person lose the capacity to make decisions for
themselves. There are two types of LPA: health and welfare, and property and
financial affairs. You can find the documents online. You can then sign and send
to the Office of the Public Guardian.
- Advance Decisions. The Mental Capacity Act allows anyone with capacity,
which is the ability to make their own decisions, to make an Advance Decision.
An Advance Decision sets out the treatments they do not want, should they
lose capacity in the future. If the person with Parkinson’s has lost capacity and
you are the appointed attorney, you can do this on their behalf.
- Advanced Statement. This is a written statement that sets down your
preferences, wishes, beliefs and values about your future care.
- Planning for end of life. The person with Parkinson’s may wish to put their
affairs, in order to feel reassured that their wishes are known. This can involve
making wills, LPAs and/or Advance
Decision. In Scotland this is known
as an Advanced Directive, and
used to be called a Living Will. The
person with Parkinson’s might
also want to consider what would
be a ‘good death’ for them, in
terms of feeling at peace. They
might wish to consult palliative
care services, which can be
accessed through the GP or
Parkinson’s nurse.
Further information can be found in the Legal, End of life and Future Care pages
Tips for coping with the future
- Start a conversation with the person you support about their views and wishes
for the future. If this is not possible then finding someone for you both to speak
to in your support network, or to a health professionals may be helpful.
- Share this with your wider family, friends and the health care team
- Make an LPA and any Advance Decision or advance statement of wishes
- Identify who might be best to help you complete forms if needed
- Inform the person with Parkinson’s health care team that you have made these

Treatment & Teams
Who May Be Involved?
You may come across a wide range of professionals. This is referred to as a “Multi-
Disciplinary Team” (MDT) approach. Who is involved will depend on your
particular circumstances and condition. This page aims to help you understand
how the system works, and who does what.
Individuals: Who’s who?
This explains the roles of the kinds of professionals you might come across. The
professionals listed below may work in GP surgeries, community services or in
hospitals. You may also meet students for each profession. They work under the
supervision of fully qualified staff. Many places of work have coded uniforms to
indicate role. If you are not sure who someone is, just ask. See extra information
below each role to find out more.
Roles (in alphabetical order):
Dietitians
- Healthcare professionals that are trained in the
science and everyday management of nutrition.
- They use the most up-to-date public health and
scientific research on food, health and disease.
They translate this into practical guidance to
enable people to make appropriate lifestyle and
food choices.
- They must be registered with the Health and Care
Professions Council (HCPC) to work as a dietician in the UK.
- Please note a nutritionist is not the same as a dietitian (though some
nutritionists are registered dietitians). A qualified nutritionist will have
knowledge about nutrition. However, they may not be trained to give
individual dietary advice to people with medical conditions. Nutritionists
are not legally required to be registered as above, though many are on
voluntary registers.
