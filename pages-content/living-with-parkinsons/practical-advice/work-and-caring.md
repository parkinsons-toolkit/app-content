### Introduction

A diagnosis of Parkinson’s does not mean you have to leave your job or stop working. Many people with Parkinson’s continue to work. The important consideration is how Parkinson’s symptoms may impact your work and daily life.

### Working with Parkinson’s

Different symptoms may cause challenges depending on your job type. For example:

- Getting around the workplace might be difficult due to mobility issues or tiredness.
- Sitting for long periods may cause dizziness upon standing.
- Physical tasks could be harder due to fatigue or motor symptoms.
- Public speaking might be challenging due to changes in speech, movements, or confidence.
- Writing or using technology may become harder due to motor symptoms.
- Working long hours can increase fatigue and cause symptoms to fluctuate.

These challenges don’t have to stop you from working if you wish to continue. You may need to adapt your job or find ways to manage these issues. For more advice, see our Symptom Management and Reading, Writing & Technology pages.

Speak with your GP or specialist about managing your symptoms for your type of work.

#### Do I need to tell my employer?

Deciding whether to inform your employer is your choice. However, you should tell them if:

- Your condition poses a health and safety risk to you or others (e.g., if you are a driver).
- You need workplace adaptations or changes, such as reduced hours.

Other factors that may affect your decision include:

- Feeling your symptoms are not noticeable or not impacting your work yet.
- Not feeling comfortable sharing your condition.
- Fear of being treated differently.
- Wanting to be open to reassure your employer of your capabilities.

#### How should I tell my employer?

Talking to others with Parkinson’s may help. They can share experiences and advice. You can also contact Parkinson’s UK groups for working-age people or visit the Parkinson’s UK Forum (details on their website).

Prepare key points to share with your employer, such as:

- A brief explanation of Parkinson’s.
- How you currently feel.
- How symptoms might affect your work now or in the future.
- Adaptations or changes that would help you.

Consider having a friend or union representative accompany you for support during conversations.

#### Do I need to tell colleagues?

You are under no legal obligation to inform your colleagues. The choice is yours.

You might decide to tell them if your condition could impact their work or health and safety.

#### How should I tell my colleagues?

If you choose to tell your colleagues:

- Decide with your manager who should speak to the team.
- Decide what information to share.
- Consider arranging for an expert (e.g., Parkinson’s nurse or Parkinson’s UK representative) to visit and inform the team.
- Remember, you should only share if you feel comfortable.

### Adjustments at Work

Under the Equality Act 2010, employers must make reasonable adjustments for employees with long-term conditions (including Parkinson’s). There are no strict definitions on the extent of adjustments, so discuss your needs with an occupational health advisor or an Access to Work assessor (via your manager or HR).

Examples of possible adjustments:

- **Hours:** You may need to reduce working hours to manage stress and symptoms better. Discuss realistic options like part-time work or fewer days per week, with flexibility as symptoms change.
- **Duties:** Some tasks might need to be delegated; you might take on different duties more manageable for you.
- **Support:** Let your employer know if you need support, such as counselling or working from home on difficult days.
- **Flexibility:** Parkinson’s symptoms can fluctuate daily; flexible working arrangements are beneficial.

Get agreed adjustments in writing, known as a workplace adjustment agreement.

If you belong to a trade union, they can support you during discussions and help with your legal rights.

### Time Off Work

UK law entitles employees to take time off if ill.

- If off work **7 days or less**, no healthcare proof is needed.
- If off for **more than 7 days**, a ‘fit note’ (sick note) from a GP or hospital doctor is required.
- Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) may apply if you are off work **more than 4 working days**, lasting up to 28 weeks. Check your contract or HR for additional sick pay schemes.
- Self-employed or zero-hours contract workers should seek advice from Citizens Advice.

#### Self-certification

For absences of 7 days or less, your employer may ask you to confirm sickness on return, usually by form or email.

#### Fit Notes

GPs or hospital doctors provide fit notes free after 7 days of sickness. With employer agreement, Allied Health Professionals (like physiotherapists or occupational therapists) can provide an alternative report.

Fit notes indicate if you are ‘not fit for work’ or ‘may be fit for work’. If ‘may be fit,’ discuss workplace adjustments with your employer. Keep the original note and provide a copy to your employer if requested.

### Annual Leave

If you do not qualify for statutory sick pay but need paid time off, you might use some of your annual leave or holiday entitlement.

### Voluntary Work

For many, voluntary work offers a good balance between working and retirement. It provides a sense of responsibility and purpose without the stress of full-time paid employment. Volunteering can also be flexible — on good days or weeks, you can do more hours; on tougher days, fewer hours. You can arrange this with the scheme or activity coordinator.

Volunteering can boost confidence and improve day-to-day wellbeing.

### Deciding Where to Volunteer

Consider what you’re passionate about and what experience you can offer. Some places to volunteer include:

- **Parkinson’s charities:** Share your knowledge and experience of living with Parkinson’s.
- **Charity shops:** Opportunities to socialize by working at the till or helping in other ways.
- **Working with animals:** Volunteer at kennels or help with dog walking locally.
- **Hospitals and care homes:** Spend time with patients or residents or help with administrative tasks.
- **Local interest groups:** Help run educational, political, church, environmental, or social organizations. For example, visit the U3A website or search online for ‘Friends of’ your local park or theatre.

---

### Adjustments for Volunteering

Similar to paid work, discuss any adjustments you may need, such as:

- Flexible hours
- Changes in duties according to your symptoms
- Times when you may not be able to attend

It’s important to have these agreements in writing and signed by both you and the organization to set clear expectations.

---

### Rights as a Volunteer

Volunteers do not have a contract of employment, so do not have the same rights as employees. However, you should have an agreement outlining:

- The support you will receive
- Level of supervision
- Expected hours and duties

### Caring for Others and Being Cared For

#### Talking to Children

Telling children or grandchildren about your Parkinson’s diagnosis can be difficult. They may already notice changes, and hiding symptoms becomes harder as Parkinson’s progresses.

When ready, be clear and specific about your symptoms, e.g., tremors or difficulty walking. Reassure them you still love them, even if you can’t do everything you used to.

If children want to talk or learn more, they can visit the Parkinson’s UK website or contact local Parkinson’s UK support services.

#### Carers

You may be a carer for someone else or have a carer for yourself. Support for carers is available through organisations such as **Carers UK** and the **Carers Trust** (contact details below). Their websites provide information and local group contacts.

Carers need to look after themselves too by taking regular breaks (respite care), which can include:

- Support workers visiting your home
- Taking holidays
- Short stays in care homes for the person being cared for

Family or friends may also help with respite care. Your local council can arrange a carer’s assessment to support this, and local Carers services may assist.

If you have financial means, paid respite or carer support is also an option. For benefits information, see our Finances page.

Some people may eventually need to move into care homes. This doesn’t mean family or friends stop being involved — many continue visiting, helping with care, and participating in care decisions. See our Housing page for supported living options.

_“…for anyone that is a carer, they must have something for themselves, either exercise or going out for coffee with friends. You have to do that.”_
