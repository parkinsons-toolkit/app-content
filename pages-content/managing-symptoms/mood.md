## What’s the difference between low mood and depression?
Everyone has times when their mood is low, and they feel unhappy about life. This can happen following a difficult event or experience. It is also possible to feel down without there being a clear reason. For some people, these periods of low mood are manageable and gradually pass. For others, low mood may persist for a long time and can affect their day-to-day life. They may find it more difficult to ‘shake it off’, even for a short time. This may indicate depression. When a person is depressed, it can affect their physical health, their appetite, and their sleep. In the same way, when a person is physically unwell it can lower their mood.

A general low mood may involve feeling sad, but it can also involve feeling emotionally ‘flat’ or ‘empty’. When a person has low mood, they can also experience some of the following:  
- Lack of self-confidence  
- Feeling worried or anxious  
- Feeling frustrated or irritable  
- Feeling tired or lacking energy  

Just because such feelings are common, it does not mean that they have to be accepted as inevitable. Making small changes in your life, such as talking about a difficult situation or increasing the amount sleep you get, can help to improve your mood. It can also help to keep as physically, mentally, and socially active as you can. 
 
A low mood which persists despite taking positive steps to help manage it can be a sign of depression. Depression is more intense and longer lasting than the short periods of low mood that anyone can experience from time to time. Depression can have the same features as low mood, plus others. 

## Symptoms of depressions
- Low, flat or empty mood lasting 2 weeks or more
- No longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to
- Feeling hopeless
- Feeling tired or lacking energy
- Difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)
- Comfort eating or losing your appetite
- Sleeping more than usual or being unable to sleep 

People may feel ‘tired of life’ and that it is not worth living, but not actually want to die. Occasionally, people with more severe depression may have thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life.

## What might be causing it?
Depression does not have a single cause. It is a result of a combination of physical changes in the brain and the body, a person’s past and current life experiences, and the ways in which they try to cope with them. People with Parkinson’s with depression have often had periods of depression earlier in their life. They may also have family members who are prone to depression. 

In Parkinson’s, the chemical changes in the brain can contribute to depression but may not directly cause it. While many people with Parkinson’s experience depression at some time, others do not despite similar brain changes. 
 
There is no evidence that drugs to treat Parkinson’s cause depression, but they also do not seem to help very much. When someone has their Parkinson’s medication changed, they may notice a change in their mood, at least at the start. The changing nature of Parkinson’s symptoms throughout the day can also mean you experience ups and downs in mood, which aren’t always a sign of depression. 
 
Depression can be difficult to diagnose in someone with Parkinson’s. This is because there can be an overlap of symptoms. For example, many people with Parkinson’s experience difficulties with sleeping. These difficulties are likely to make you feel tired and lacking in energy. They therefore do not necessarily mean you’re depressed. Also, changes in facial movements in Parkinson’s can affect facial expression which can be misunderstood. For example, someone may look sad when they are not. 
 
Depression is more common in people who have many different long-term health conditions, not just Parkinson’s. Depression can also be caused by other common conditions not related to Parkinson’s, such as arthritis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This tells us that having any long-term health condition may be the most important factor causing depression.

## What Should I Do About It?
There are many things you can try to help you deal with low mood or depression (see below ‘What can I try for myself?’). At times, feelings of low mood are completely normal. But, if you have these feelings for most of the day, every day for more than 2 weeks, you should make an appointment with your GP. Your GP can assess whether your symptoms suggest that you are depressed. Depending on the outcome, they may recommend medication or a talking therapy (see the <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies
/complementary-therapies" class="internal-link">_Complementary Therapies_</a>) page.

In some situations, depression can need urgent attention. This may be if you are experiencing any of the following: 
- Great emotional distress
- Repeated thoughts of death or suicidal ideas
- Thoughts of self-harm or harming others 

If you or a family member feels there is an immediate risk, you should go to your nearest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. There will be a trained mental health care professional available that you can see. If you cannot get to A&E yourself, you or someone else can call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

If you need immediate help but don’t want to go to A&E, you could: 
- Call Samaritans on Freephone 116 123 – they're open 24 hours a day and are there to listen
- Contact your GP and ask for an emergency appointment
- Contact NHS 111 (England) or NHS Direct 0845 46 47 (Wales)
- Contact your local crisis team (CRHT), if you’re under their care.

## What Can I Try For Myself?
There are many things you can do that may help to improve your mood. Not all of them help everyone, but they are all worth trying. In most cases, they are important for our health and well- being, not just as a way to manage low mood or depression.

### Activity  
Exercising regularly can help boost your mood as well as help you sleep. You may choose to do this by taking regular walks, going to the gym, joining a sports team, going to classes for dance, yoga or tai chi. They can also be a source of relaxation and a chance to see other people. But achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as making small changes to your everyday routines. For example: 
- Tidy up a bit faster when doing the housework
- Use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator
- Leave the car at home for short journeys
- Get off the bus a stop earlier and walk the rest of the journey
- See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing
/keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> for more guidance.

If you have any concerns about safe and suitable exercise routines, discuss with your GP or a physiotherapist who will be able to recommend exercise that is right for you.

### Diet  
Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone. The food you eat can affect the way you feel, both physically and mentally, and how you feel can affect the food you eat. So, healthy eating habits can improve your mood and general sense of wellbeing. 
 
For example, people who are depressed can often crave ‘junk food’ that is high in sugar and salt. These foods can briefly lift our mood but can lead to highs and lows in our blood glucose. We might also feel guilty for over-eating this type of food. This can cause our mood to fluctuate and leave us feeling irritable and tired. On the other hand, some people who are depressed may not feel like eating and are at risk of becoming underweight. 
 
It can be beneficial to limit your alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol frequently can lead to depression as it lowers your mood (it has a depressant effect on mood). Alcohol also affects sleep. While alcohol can initially make you feel more sleepy, it affects your sleep quality. If you drink alcohol before going to bed you are less likely to have a refreshing night’s sleep. 
 
See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing
/eating-well" class="internal-link">_Eating Well_</a> page for more guidance.

### Keeping socially active and combat loneliness  
When a person is depressed, they often cut themselves off from other people. Even when not depressed, many people can feel isolated and lonely. This can make depression more likely. 

Socialising can improve your mood. Staying in contact with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Talking to others with Parkinson’s can also help by sharing your experiences and learning about different coping mechanisms or solutions to similar problems. 

Look out for new opportunities from activities offered through local colleges, places of worship (e.g. churches, mosques, temples), community centres, leisure facilities, charities and societies (e.g. your local U3A group). Your local library can be a good source of information about what is available in your area. We have listed some other possible sources in our _Practical Advice_ pages which you can within the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons" class="internal-link">_Living with Parkinson's_</a> section. If you need support speicifally with travelling to events, see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/travel" class="internal-link">_Travel_</a> page for advice. 
 
Visit our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing
/social-and-spiritual-life" class="internal-link">_Social & Spiritual Life_</a> page for more information on how you can keep socially active. 

### Sleep
Depression and anxiety can both affect the quality of our sleep. Similarly, when our sleep is disturbed by other things it can negatively affect our mood. Improving your sleep is one of the best ways to manage low mood and depression. There are a few things you can try to help improve the amount and quality of your sleep: 
- Have a strict bed time routine, going to bed at the same time each night.
- Leave yourself time to wind down before bed (e.g. avoid using electronic devices for at least an hour before you go to bed as these may have a negative effect on sleep).
- Try to relax before going to bed (e.g. reading, a warm bath, gentle music, relaxation or stretching exercises).
- Write a “to do” list for the next day before bed can help to clear your mind of any distractions.
- Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable.
- Try to avoid caffeine (e.g. tea and coffee) after 2pm. 
 
See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/sleep" class="internal-link"></a> p_Sleep_age for more tips on how to improve the amount and quality of your sleep. 

### Relaxation and Breathing Exercises
It’s important to try and make time to relax. Try doing things you find restful, such as listening to music, reading a book, going for a walk, or getting creative by painting or colouring. See the _Mind_ charity website, along with other useful resources, linked at the bottom of this page, for more tips on how to incorporate relaxation into your daily life.

It can also help to practise calming breathing techniques. This can reduce any stress and boost your emotional well-being. See our _Dealing with Stress & Challenges_ page for a simple breathing exercise you can try. 

### Mindfulness
Mindfulness encourages you to pay closer attention to the present moment, focusing on your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and your environment. Doing this regularly can help to improve your general emotional wellbeing. 

Mindfulness is often included as part of psychological treatment. It is recommended by the National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to help prevent the recurrence of depression in people that have had several episodes over their lifetime. Mindfulness groups and courses are available in some areas. The _Mind_ website gives more information on these and other ways to learn Mindfulness. Visit the NHS Mental Health & Wellbeing pages for more information on how mindfulness can help mental wellbeing. It also gives guidance on how we can incorporate mindfulness into our day-to-day lives. You can find links in our More Information section below.

### Keep a Gratitude Diary
Keeping a diary of the things you’re grateful for may lift your mood have a positive effect on your mental wellbeing. Try to describe one thing you’re grateful for and do this twice a week. You can write about anything that comes to mind, as long as it makes you feel grateful. For example, it could be something very little that has happened or a person that you’re grateful for.

_Tips for keeping a gratitude diary..._
- Take time to think about something that you’re truly grateful for.
- Writing about people you’re grateful for tends to have more of a positive effect than writing about things or events.
- Try to include as much detail as possible about _why_ you’re grateful.
- Plan a time when you will write in your diary. Consider setting an alarm on your phone if you find that you are forgetting to write your diary entries

### Complementary Therapies

Complementary therapies like massage, acupuncture, and aromatherapy may promote relaxation and wellbeing. Though not clinically proven to treat depression, some people with Parkinson’s find them helpful.

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse before using anything by mouth or on your skin.

See our Complementary Therapy page for more details.

# Resources for Wellbeing and Mental Health

There are many apps designed to support wellbeing and specific mental health needs. Most are not clinically tested. If interested, explore the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.

Books can also help. The Reading Well Books on Prescription website offers recommendations, many available via your local library. See More Information below for links.

---

# Self-Help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)

CBT focuses on how feelings, thoughts, and behaviour influence each other, potentially causing or worsening depression. There are NHS-recommended self-help CBT books for depression, accessible through local libraries via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme.

For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse, or visit the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.

# My Experience

> “Sometimes I do have a good old moan and I do have a bit of a cry, because I feel so frustrated when I can’t do what I want to do. But then I just have to pick myself up and get going again.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*

> “I can have a bad day, I can have days when my mood swings are not very happy because I don’t feel very well. When I’m not well, I’m obviously not happy. That’s why watching a film sometimes helps because you’re into the film. And you can ignore the fact of how you’re probably feeling. I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*

# Further Assessment

## Questions to Consider

Healthcare professionals may ask:  
- How often are you affected by low mood and how long does it last?  
- How is low mood affecting your life?  
- Are you no longer enjoying things you used to?  
- Are you feeling hopeless?  
- Are you tired or lacking energy?  
- Do you have difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g., watching TV)?  
- Are you comfort eating or losing your appetite?  
- Are you sleeping more than usual or unable to sleep?  
- Do you have suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm?  
- Do you sometimes see or hear things that aren’t really there? Any other unusual experiences?

## Symptom and Activity Tracker

Tracking symptoms can help recall details and identify patterns. If mood fluctuates, track it over 2-3 days to see when it worsens. Record sleep patterns if variable, note factors affecting mood, and medication times to identify relationships.

## Tests

Your healthcare professional may perform examinations or blood/urine tests to check for other causes of depression, such as thyroid issues or blood imbalances.

---

# Further Treatments

Your healthcare professional can give specific self-help advice, refer you to other services, or discuss medication.

## Referral

- Typically for talking therapies or mental health teams.  
- Your GP or specialist can refer you.  
- In England, you can self-refer for talking therapies via [NHS Psychological Therapies Service](https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/).  
- There may be long waiting times for NHS therapy.

Talking therapies provide a safe, confidential place to discuss difficulties with a trained professional. Sessions may be one-to-one or in small groups. Various types exist but all aim to improve wellbeing.

See additional information on talking therapies for details.

# Complementary Therapies  
Complementary therapies include massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. These therapies have not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them. These therapies may not directly treat the depression but can be helpful for relaxation and general wellbeing.  

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if you wish to take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a complementary therapy.  

See our Complementary Therapy page for more information.  

# Resources for Wellbeing and Mental Health  
There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. Most of them have not been tested. If you want to try one, look at the mental health apps and tools in the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.  

There are also many books that might be helpful. The Reading Well Books on Prescription website has some ideas. Many of these books will be available through your local library. You can find the link in our More Information section below.  

# Self-help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy  
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of depression (see ‘Further Treatments’ for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by the NHS for people with depression. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.  

# My Experience  
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.  

> “Sometimes I do have a good old moan and I do have a bit of a cry, because I feel so frustrated when I can’t do what I want to do. But then I just have to pick myself up and get going again.” (Person with Parkinson’s)  

> “I can have a bad day, I can have days when my mood swings are not very happy because I don’t feel very well. When I’m not well, I’m obviously not happy. That’s why watching a film sometimes helps because you’re into the film. And you can ignore the fact of how you’re probably feeling. I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.” (Person with Parkinson’s)  

# Further Assessment  

### Questions  
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.  
- See extra information below about things they might ask about with regard to mood.  

  - How often you are affected by low mood and how long does it last?  
  - How is low mood affecting your life?  
  - Are you no longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to?  
  - Are you feeling hopeless?  
  - Are you feeling tired or lacking energy?  
  - Are you having difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)?  
  - Are you comfort eating or losing your appetite?  
  - Are you sleeping more than usual or unable to sleep?  
  - Are you having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm?  
  - Do you sometimes see or hear things that are not really there? Do you have any other unusual experiences?  

### Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker  
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.  
- If your mood fluctuates during the day, track it over 2-3 days to see when it bothers you most. You could also record your sleep patterns if these vary. You could note any factors that you think may be related (i.e. things that seem to make your mood worse and things that seem to help). Also record when you take your medication as there may be a relationship.  

### Tests  
Depending on their assessment, your healthcare professional may wish to examine you and carry out blood or urine tests. Such tests are used to look for other causes of depression, such as thyroid conditions or imbalances in the blood (e.g. high calcium levels).  

# Further Treatments  
Your healthcare professional may be able to give you more specific advice about things you could try yourself. They might also refer you on to another service or discuss the option of medication.  

### Referral  
- Referral would typically be for talking therapies or to mental health teams. Your GP can refer you, and it may also be available through your specialist team. In England you can also self-refer for talking therapies without going through your GP through https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/. There can be a long wait to start therapy on the NHS.  
- Talking therapies offer a safe, confidential place to talk to a trained professional about any difficulties you are having.  
  - Therapy sessions can be one-to-one with the therapist or in small groups.  
  - There is lots of different types of talking therapies, but they all have the same aim of improving your wellbeing. See extra information below about talking therapies.  

  - **Counselling:** Counselling can help you cope with mild versions of common mental health problems, including depression. It might also help you to talk about a specific event or cause for your low mood, such as relationship difficulties or a bereavement. Counselling may be available on the NHS. It can also be available for free through your employer. Some charities offer cheap or free talking therapies or group support. This includes Cruse for bereavement care, Relate for relationship counselling and Mind. Some private counsellors also offer discounted rates for those on low incomes. See our More information section for details on how to find a trained and accredited therapist.  

  - **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT):** CBT aims to help you understand how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour influence each other. Your therapist will aim to teach you skills in identifying and overcoming ‘unhelpful’ or negative thoughts to help you cope better and reduce symptoms of depression. CBT typically involves a course of weekly sessions and may be delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or specially trained nurse. For people with milder depression, treatment can be done via computer from your own home with support from a mental health care professional. CBT for depression will include looking to help associated problems such as sleep, lack of physical activity, and social isolation. CBT is available on the NHS by self-referral or through your GP.  

  - **Other therapies:** While CBT is the most commonly offered therapy, other therapies might also be available and recommended. A wide range of other therapies exist. The British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP) has an A-Z of therapies, which explains what they are. You can talk to your GP or NHS psychological therapy service about other types of therapy available in your area.  

# Medication  
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.  
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.  
- See extra information below about medication used for low mood.  

  - **Antidepressants:** For moderate to severe depression, antidepressant medication may be prescribed alone or recommended in combination with talking therapy. ‘Combination Therapy’ of antidepressant medication with talking therapy can result in better outcomes than just receiving one of these treatments. Research has not yet identified a specific type of anti-depressant to recommend specifically for people with Parkinson’s. There is some evidence for tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline. There is limited evidence for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram or sertraline in Parkinson’s specifically. There is good evidence however that they can work for moderate or severe depression in the general population. While some antidepressants work very well for some people they have no effect for others. Usually, a person is tried on one medicine at increasing doses for several weeks to see if it helps. If it does not, then the drug should be slowly withdrawn and a different drug tried. Anti-depressants are not addictive but they should not be stopped suddenly. If none of the main drugs seem to help, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further advice. You can read more about different anti-depressant drugs and potential side effects here.  

  - **Parkinson’s medicines:** There is some research evidence for the dopamine agonist pramipexole, but the effects are modest. Other Parkinson’s drugs have no obvious antidepressant effect.  

  - **St John’s wort:** St John’s wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for mild-moderate depression. It is not recommended by doctors and should never be combined with prescribed antidepressants. In particular, it should not be taken by people with Parkinson’s as it can interact with a lot of medication, including Parkinson’s medication. It is important you let your healthcare professionals know if you are taking this.  

- Some medication can make your mood worse. See extra information below about some of these medicines. If you are depressed and taking any of these you should not stop them without speaking with your GP for advice.  

  - Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam  
  - Pain killers: opiates  
  - Steroid medication, e.g. prednisolone  
  - Beta blockers, e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol  
  - Hormonal medicine, e.g. some Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) used for menopausal symptoms or hormonal contraceptive medicines.  

# Key Messages  
- Low mood is common and there are many things that you can do to prevent or help it.  
- Depression is more intense and longer lasting than the short periods of low mood that anyone can have from time to time.  
- Things you can do to improve your mood, even if you are not depressed: keep physically and socially active; maintain a healthy diet; improve sleep; and make time to relax.  
- There is a wide range of possible treatments for depression. Those offered by healthcare professionals include talking therapies and medication.

# Anxiety

Anxiety is the feeling of worry or fear, including a general sense of unease. This feeling can range in intensity from mild to severe.

Everyone can experience feelings of anxiety at some time in their life. Anxiety is a natural response to situations that we find stressful or threatening. For example, this might be about your health, moving house or work-related problems. It may subside once the situation changes or the person becomes used to the situation. But sometimes feelings of anxiety can last for long periods of time and without a clear cause. This can be troubling for the person and can affect their day-to-day life.

## Common symptoms of anxiety

There are a range of symptoms experienced with anxiety which varies from person to person. Listed below are some of the more common features:

| Body Sensations                        | Thoughts & Feelings                         | Changes in Behaviour                               |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| • Muscle pain or tension              | • A sense of dread                          | • Repeated checking or seeking reassurance        |
| • Heart beating fast, or palpitations| • Constant worry                           | • Avoiding situations or places that are associated with stress or anxiety |
| • Dizziness                          | • Difficulty concentrating                  | • Restlessness                                     |
| • Feeling sick                      | • Feeling detached from your environment   |                                                   |
| • Dry mouth                        | • Feeling on edge and alert to things around you |                                           |
| • Tingling sensations (particularly in the hands and feet) | • Feeling agitated or irritable            |                                                   |
| • Difficulty breathing or feeling breathless |                                          |                                                   |
| • Sweating                         |                                            |                                                   |
| • Trembling                       |                                            |                                                   |

The body sensations are the physical response to stress and threat. However, the same sensations can be caused by a number of acute and long-term physical health conditions including Parkinson’s.  
They can also be a side effect of some medications. If someone is experiencing the body sensations without the thoughts and feelings or changes in behaviour, they are unlikely to be anxious.

Worry is one of the most common features of anxiety in people with Parkinson’s. Some worry is normal. Indeed, a bit of worry can be useful as it forces us to think ahead and plan for stressful events. But worry can become excessive, taking up much of our time as well as our emotional energy. Such worry is often unproductive – it does not lead to solutions to problems. Instead, it traps us in a cycle of ‘what-ifs’ and expecting the worse. While we can sometimes distract ourselves from such worry, it tends to come back – often when we are trying to sleep.

Anxiety also changes our behaviour; we look for ways to reduce unpleasant body sensations and distressing thoughts and feelings. For example, we might be repeatedly check we have done something or ask for reassurance from others. These behaviours can give short-term relief, but they do not break the cycle. The most common behaviour change in anxiety is avoidance. Once we work out what we are afraid of, it makes sense to avoid it. This is OK sometimes. However, it becomes a problem if it leads to us avoiding going out of the house, using public transport or socialising. Although avoidance can lead to a short-term reduction in anxiety, it makes whatever we are avoiding even more frightening.

## What sorts of things are people with Parkinson’s anxious about?

Uncertainty about the future can be difficult and can cause anxiety and worry. This might be particularly the case with health conditions that have an unpredictable course, such as Parkinson’s.

Some people are generally anxious about any stressful and potentially threatening situation. For others, it is more specific. For example, they may feel very anxious in social situations or in crowded places with lots of strangers around. People will often feel anxious before and during such situations. In a few people, the anxiety may increase very suddenly – a so-called ‘panic attack’. These can be very distressing. A person will often avoid situations where they have had a panic attack in the past.

## What might be causing it?

Anxiety can be caused by a combination of factors. Such factors include imbalances in brain chemicals, genetics, and stressful life events. People who have been anxious throughout their life may find that their anxiety has got worse since their Parkinson’s started. This may be due to the brain changes, or because Parkinson’s increases the number of ‘threats’ faced day-to-day. In other words, they may have more to be anxious about.

Some symptoms of Parkinson’s can cause anxiety or make it worse. For example, after a fall or loss of balance, you may develop a fear of falling. See the Balance and Falls page for guidance on this.

Some people experience anxiety when their medication is wearing off. This improves once they take their next dose of medication. You can also feel anxious if your medication is wearing off and you experience difficulties moving. You may find that when your movement symptoms are better controlled by medication, your levels of anxiety reduce.

Alcohol, caffeine, and some illicit drugs can make anxiety worse. Withdrawing from a substance or medication can also increase anxiety levels. Hormonal imbalances, such as high thyroid hormone levels, are another possible cause of anxiety.

## What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try to help you deal with anxiety (see ‘What can I try for myself?’). If anxiety is having a big impact on your life, you should speak to a healthcare professional. In some cases, anxiety has a negative impact on other symptoms of Parkinson’s. For example, stress and anxiety can make tremor worse, interfere with walking, and increase the risk of falls. Seeking support early can give you more control and help you manage feelings of anxiety.

Anxiety and depression often occur at the same time, and anxiety can make depression even more difficult to live with. You should seek urgent professional help if you are feeling great emotional distress or are experiencing feelings that are difficult to manage. These can include thoughts of death, suicidal ideas, thoughts of self-harm, panic attacks, flashbacks, and paranoia or hearing voices. You should speak to your GP in the first instance or go to A&E if not available and you are experiencing these. You can normally get an emergency appointment through your GP practice for urgent mental health concerns.

If you need immediate help but don’t want to see your GP or go to A&E, you could:  
• Call Samaritans on Freephone 116 123. They're open 24 hours a day and are there to listen  
• Contact NHS 111 (England) or NHS Direct 0845 46 47 (Wales)  
• If you are under the care of a local crisis team, contact them  

For more details, the charity Mind has information about how to seek urgent mental health support.

## What can I try for myself?

There are many things you can try to help manage and reduce anxiety. These include:

### Activity

Being more active can help to combat stress and reduce anxiety. You may choose to do this by going to the gym or going to classes e.g. dance, yoga, or tai chi. But achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as making small changes to your everyday routines. For example:  
• Tidy up a bit faster when doing the housework  
• Extending walks to the shops/other errands a bit further, or going more often  
• Use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator  
• Leave the car at home for short journeys  
• Get off the bus a stop earlier and walking the rest of the journey  
See Keeping Active pages for more guidance.

If you have any concerns about safe and suitable exercise routines, discuss with your GP or a physiotherapist who will be able to recommend exercise that is right for you.

### Diet

Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone. The food we eat can affect the way we feel, both physically and mentally, and how we feel can affect the food we eat. Anxiety can make you feel nauseous, or reduce your appetite, and it is important to still eat healthily if it is affecting you in this way. Some people ‘comfort eat’ when they feel anxious, for example extra sugary foods, which might lead to feeling guilty and increasing anxiety further.

It can help to cut down on the amount of caffeine (found in tea, coffee, and some fizzy drinks) and alcohol you drink. This is because these can make some symptoms of anxiety (e.g. heart racing) worse.

Healthy eating habits can play an important role in improving our mood and general sense of well-being. See Eating Well for more guidance.

### Keep socially active

Sharing any worries or fears you may have with a friend or family member may help to reduce anxiety levels. Talking to others with Parkinson’s can also help by sharing your experiences and learning about different coping mechanisms or solutions to similar problems.

You can look out for new opportunities from activities offered through local colleges, churches, leisure facilities, charities, and societies. You can search for activities and groups in your area on the government website gov.uk. Your local library can also be a good source of information about what is available in your area. If you need support with travelling to events, see our Travel page for advice.

Visit our Social & Spiritual Life & Spiritual page for more information on how you can keep socially active.

### Sleep

Many people with anxiety or worry may find it difficult getting to sleep. Our sleep page has some information on this and what you can try to help.

### Relaxation

It’s important to try and make time to relax. Try doing things you find restful. This might be listening to music, reading a book, going for a walk, or getting creative by painting or colouring.

See the Mind charity website for more tips on how to incorporate relaxation into your daily life. They also have example relaxation exercises you can try.

### Breathing strategies

Calming breathing exercises can help to reduce anxiety. When you feel anxious, you are more likely to take rapid, shallow breaths. This can cause sensations such as increased heart rate, dizziness, and muscle tension. In turn, this can increase feelings of anxiety. So, doing simple breathing exercises can help you to relax and reduce anxiety levels. These exercises work best when they’re practised regularly. You can even make them part of your daily routine (e.g. doing some deep breathing while waiting for the kettle to boil).

Here’s an example of a simple breathing exercise you can try:  
• Get into a position that you find comfortable (this can be standing, sitting, lying, etc.).  
• Try to keep your shoulders down and relaxed and place your hand on your stomach.  
• Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach rise as you breathe in and fall as you breathe out.  
• You may find it helpful to count steadily as you breathe: ‘one, two, three, four, five’ as you breathe in and ‘one, two, three, four, five’ as you breathe out. Try to work out what feels comfortable for you.  
• Repeat for 3-5 minutes.

### Mindfulness

Mindfulness encourages you to pay closer attention to the present moment, focusing on your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and your environment. By doing this regularly it can help to improve your general emotional well-being.

Mindfulness is often included as part of psychological treatment. It encourages you to notice any stress or anxiety you might be feeling and can help you to deal with this better. Visit the NHS Mental Health & Wellbeing pages for more information on how mindfulness can help our mental well-being. You can find the link in our More Information section below. It also gives guidance on how we can incorporate mindfulness into our day-to-day lives.

### Complementary therapies

Complementary therapies include massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. These therapies have not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them. These therapies may not directly treat the anxiety but can be helpful for relaxation and general well-being.

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if you wish to take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a complementary therapy.

See our Complementary Therapy page for more information.

## Resources for wellbeing and mental health

There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. If you want to try one, look at the mental health apps and tools in the NHS Apps Library on the NHS website.

Here is a selection of self-help leaflets available online that might be helpful. You can find these in our More Information section. Alternatively, there are some books (e.g., ‘The worry cure’ By Robert Leahy). The Reading Well Books on Prescription web page has some other suggestions. Many of these books will be available through your local library or available to buy from local bookstores or online.

Some books are available in audiobook format, if preferred.

There are also some websites that have a wide range of advice and resources groups. You can pay to become a member of these groups, if you wish. See the More Information section.

### Self-help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of anxiety (see ‘Further Treatments’ for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by the NHS for people with anxiety. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit the Reading Well Books on Prescription website.

### Worry management

There are some simple tricks that we can use to take back control of our repetitive unproductive worry.

• ‘Worry time’: worry thoughts can happen at any time. The thing we are worrying about may be important so we feel that deserves our attention. However, it can get in the way of other things. One simple trick is to plan one or two short periods of ‘worry time’ during the day. These are the times that you allow yourself to worry. Because you know that you can come back to the worry later, it is easier to switch it off at the time it pops into your head. Interestingly, when your scheduled worry time comes along, the worry often does not seem so worrying.

Make a note of your worry and come back to it later: Worries often run through our minds when we have no distractions. Unfortunately, this is often when we are trying to relax or sleep. Keep a notebook beside your bed or arm-chair and jot down a quick note about the worry. Then come back to it later – either during your worry time or in the morning. Again, the worry often seems less powerful

A small study of self-help, using these and other simple techniques, showed that they can significantly reduce the amount of time that people spend worrying. The study used an short guide published on- line in Australia called ‘What? Me Worry?’ available in our More Information section. 
 
## Avoid avoidance 
Avoidance is a central feature of anxiety. It helps in the short-term but makes things worse overall. It can also restrict important aspects of day-to-day living. 
 
Avoidance tends to build up gradually and is something that we learn to do – without intending it. 
We unlearn avoidance if we realise that we can cope with the stressful situation, even if it is difficult. 
Often avoidance is an all-or-none response. For example, if shopping is difficult because of crowds, it is better to change the time or the place to one that is less crowded, rather than avoiding shops completely. This is adapting to the situation rather than avoiding it. 
 
Practical planning and problem-solving can remove some stress and make avoidance less likely. This advanced thinking is much more productive than worry. Friends and family can often help find solutions to help you do the things that you are tending to avoid. But, it is important that they don’t encourage avoidance thinking that this will help you feel less anxious. 
 
## My Experience 
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences. 
 
> “In a sense, this is a similar process to a bereavement and you need time to adjust before getting back on an even keel. I worried that the level of anxiety I felt in the weeks after diagnosis were a symptom of Parkinson's and would be with me for life. When a distant friend told me that life would be good again, I remember being really surprised but also encouraged.” (Person with Parkinson’s) 
 
> “It’s weird. There's no reason, absolutely no reason why I should be [anxious]. It just seems to build up and get worse. No, I can't put it down to anything. There's nothing in particular that I can think of that makes it start. It just comes over you. ….I think if I just breathe. What I usually do is I’ll sit back and I’ll sort of take deep breaths and then I just sort of think, ‘calm down, just calm down’, you know, and sort of bring myself back again. So, that’s the only way I can get out of it, really. Or go and sit and do some drawing or go sit and put the television on and takes my mind off it” (Person with Parkinson’s) 
 
## Further Assessment 
At times, feelings of anxiety are completely normal. But, anxiety can begin to disrupt your day-to-day life or cause you distress. If this is the case, it is important to seek help from healthcare professionals. 
 
### Questions 
- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment. 
- See extra information below to see things they might ask about with regard to anxiety. 
 
  - Are you experiencing any physical symptoms? If so, what are these? 
  - What life events or stressors are happening? 
  - Are there any triggers for your anxiety? 
  - Thoughts or actions related to mood, such as thinking about self-harm or suicide 
  - How anxiety is impacting your life, for example your sleep 
 
### Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker 
- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns. 
- Monitor when you’re anxious and what’s happening for you at that time. Write down anything that may be related to the anxiety (i.e. things that seem to make your anxiety worse and things that appear to make it better). Make a note of any physical symptoms and when you take your medication. Try to do this for three days – this should be enough to be able to look for a pattern. 
- It is best not to get too caught up in monitoring your symptoms as this can make anxiety worse. 
 
## Tests 
Tests are not usually needed when assessing for anxiety. But your healthcare professional may wish to examine you or carry out tests, such as blood tests. This would help to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms. 
 
## Further Treatments 
Your healthcare professional may be able to give you more specific advice about things you could try yourself. They might also refer you on to another service or discuss the option of medication. 

### Referral 
- There is often a waiting time before that next service will see you. Referral would typically be for talking therapies or to mental health teams. 
- Talking therapies are often first choice for anxiety. 
  - They offer a safe, confidential place to talk to a trained professional about any difficulties you are having. 
  - Therapy sessions can be one-to-one with the therapist or in small groups. 
  - There are various types of talking therapies, but they all aim to improve your well-being. See extra information below about talking therapies. 
  - **Counselling**: Counselling can help you cope with mild versions of common mental health problems, including anxiety. 
  - **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)**: CBT focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour influence each other and can lead to, or worsen, feelings of anxiety. It works by encouraging you to change these patterns by challenging ‘unhelpful’ thoughts and behaviour. There is evidence that CBT is particularly effective in treating anxiety, but it can also help you cope with chronic health problems. CBT typically involves a course of weekly sessions. It can be delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or specially trained nurse. Treatment for mild anxiety can be done via computer from your own home with support from a mental health care professional. 
  - **Link worker service**: Most areas in England now offer a link worker service. You can ask about this at your GP practice. This is someone who can help link you up to local support available in your area. This might include activities and groups related to your interests, or local low cost counselling or other support options. 
 
## Medication 
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication. 
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional. 
- If severe anxiety is affecting your quality of life, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team may discuss the option of medication. There are different types of medication available for anxiety and the choice is personal to you. But, there are none specifically recommended for Parkinson’s’ and there have been no clinical trials looking into this. 
- See extra information below about medication used for anxiety. 
 
  - Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs), e.g. sertraline and citalopram 
  - Other medications also used for depression, e.g. mirtazapine or Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) like venlafaxine 
  - Some drugs also used to for pain e.g. gabapentin or pregabalin 
  - Very occasionally, short term use of benzodiazepines 
  - Sometimes beta blockers are used for symptoms of panic. It should be used with caution as it can lower blood pressure. 
 
- See extra information below about some medications that may worsen anxiety. 
 
  - Caffeine - this is present in some over-the-counter pain killers and flu remedies 
  - Some decongestants 
  - Steroid medication 
  - Medication used for asthma (e.g. salbutamol) 
  - Levothyroxine 

## Key Messages 
- Anxiety is the feeling of worry or fear, including a general sense of unease. It can range in intensity from mild to severe. 
- There are many things you can do to help improve your mood, even if you don’t have anxiety. These include exercise, maintaining a healthy diet, improving sleep, and making time to relax. You can also tackle worry and avoidance. 
- Treatments for anxiety offered by healthcare professionals include talking therapies and medication.

## Loss of Interest or Drive

Loss of interest or drive is sometimes called **apathy**.  
It is not the same as feeling low or depressed, although it can also be part of depression.

- To outsiders, apathy can be mistaken for laziness, but it can be a **symptom of Parkinson’s**.
- For some, it affects engagement with hobbies or pastimes.
- For others, it impacts routine daily activities such as self-care.

### Apathy vs Avoidance
- **Avoidance**: Not doing something because it is too difficult.
- **Apathy**: The person *can* do it (especially with encouragement) but has no desire or ability to start without prompting.
- Someone with apathy is **not avoiding** — they simply have no wish to do it or cannot get started.

If you feel like you have **lost your spark** or **can’t be bothered to do anything**, that might be apathy.

## What Might Be Causing It?

Apathy is a symptom of Parkinson’s as well as other neurological conditions.  
There is evidence that it is linked to the levels of dopamine in the brain.  
This link is different from how dopamine affects movement.

- Apathy in Parkinson’s can be present by itself.
- It can also be linked to low mood, memory, and thinking problems.

---

## What Should I Do About It?

The feeling of apathy can be hard to change. There is no quick fix, but:

- Routinely talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
- They can assess for a cause and potentially treat related symptoms.

Even if your interest and drive are low, it is important to remain active.  
Managing apathy benefits mental and physical health and helps those you live with.

## What Can I Try for Myself?

There are three main ways to tackle apathy:

1. **Establish a routine** so the activity becomes a habit.
2. **Build a menu** of activities to choose from.
3. **Agree with others** that they can prompt or remind you.

---

### Establishing a Routine

- Apathy tends to affect less frequent, optional activities.
- Regular habits are less affected.
- A daily or weekly routine can help tackle apathy and improve mood.
- Best routines include variety, with activities from different categories:

#### Chores
- Household or garden tasks you may have stopped doing.
- Could include taking over tasks from family members.
- May not be fun but are useful and often physically active.

#### Hobbies and Pastimes
- Often affected early in apathy.
- Find activities you can still do and include 1–2 in your routine.  
  *See Hobbies & Pets page for more advice.*

#### Physical Activity
- Apathy can cause physical inactivity.
- Include chores, hobbies, and exercise to stay active.
- Even small amounts of exercise are valuable.  
  *See Keeping Active page for more advice.*

#### Social Activity
- Plan chances to be around others (family, friends, groups).
- Schedule 2–3 activities each week (calls, visits, groups).
- Combine with hobbies, pastimes, or exercise.  
  *See Social & Spiritual Life page for more advice.*

---

### Make a ‘Menu’

- Helps for times when you feel like you have nothing to do.
- Easier to choose from a list than think from scratch.
- Keep it small, varied, and avoid activities that are too long or complex.
- Include options from chores, hobbies, physical, and social activities.

---

### The Importance of Prompts and Reminders

- People with apathy often don’t act without prompting.
- Family should feel encouraged to give reminders (not “nagging”).
- Prompts can include:
  - Talking through the daily routine.
  - Encouraging use of the activity menu.

## My Experience

> “I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.”  
> *Person with Parkinson’s*

---

## Further Assessment

### Questions Professionals Might Ask
- How is your mood?
- Have you noticed any changes in your memory or thinking?
- Are there times when you feel engaged vs disinterested, or is it continuous?
- Any relationship with your medication?

---

## Tracking Symptoms

- Helps recall details and identify patterns.
- If remembering is difficult, note in a diary a few days before the appointment.
- Avoid tracking for long periods (over a week) as it’s not likely to help.

---

## Tests

- Usually not needed to assess apathy.

---

## Further Treatments

- Few specific treatments for apathy itself.
- If related to depression → treatment (therapy or antidepressants) may help.
- If linked to memory/thinking problems → medication such as rivastigmine may help.
- Support groups may be available.
- If impacting daily living → referral to occupational therapy or social services for a Needs Assessment.

---

## Key Messages

- Apathy can be a symptom of Parkinson’s, linked to mood or thinking problems, or happen alone.
- A structured routine, easier choices, and prompts/reminders are important for management.
