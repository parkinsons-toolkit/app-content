# Mobility

Mobility is quite a broad term and includes:

- Walking around
- Getting up or down stairs
- Getting in and out of bed
- Rolling over in bed: ‘bed mobility’
- Getting up from or sitting down into a chair

Reduced mobility may make everyday activities more challenging for you than they used to be. There are many things you can do for yourself. It is also advised that you see a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. They will work with you to help you continue doing the things you need and enjoy doing in your daily life.

Symptoms of Parkinson’s and factors unrelated to Parkinson’s can all contribute to reduced mobility. These factors are discussed on the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/balance-and-falls" class="internal-link">_Balance & Falls page_</a>. Treatment of the symptoms causing problems is important for maintaining mobility. Please explore the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages for specific guidance.

A common problem is that difficulties mobilising mean that you are less active. Being less active then leads to muscle weakness and stiffness. Muscle weakness and stiffness then leads to more difficulty in mobilising. Lack of confidence and fear of falling also feeds into this cycle. It is important to break this cycle.

## What should I do about it?

If you have a sudden decline in your mobility, you should see your GP or contact your Parkinson’s team as soon as possible. There may be an illness, injury or medication that is contributing to it. Please see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/balance-and-falls" class="internal-link">_Balance & Falls page_</a> information page if these are concerns.

If you have difficulties moving, you should be referred to a physiotherapist. In the NHS, you usually have to be referred by your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. You may also benefit from Occupational Therapist or Adult Social Care services.

Appointments with these specialists may be in a hospital, community service, or at home. In some areas there are specialist Parkinson’s teams or rehab services. Your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP should be able to advise. See the <a href="/learn/treatment-and-therapies/who-may-be-involved" class="internal-link">_Who May be Involved_</a> page for more information about the different services.

## What can I try for myself?

### Keep Active

It is important to try to stay as active as possible, unless you have been advised otherwise. Staying active helps you maintain muscle strength and balance so helps maintain mobility. It is also good for your Parkinson’s and general health. There are different components to the activity you should try to undertake: Strength, balance and flexibility. Mobility requires all of these.

In Parkinson’s, specific attention also needs to be given to:

- Making big movements
- Carrying out more than one task at a time, known as ‘dual-tasking’.

Exercises to achieve these need to be tailored to your ability and needs. For more on all of these aspects, see the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> page.

There may also be specific tasks that you can practice to address specific day-to-day challenges. Physiotherapists and Occupational therapists help identify these where possible.

### Mobility tips

- Give yourself time.
- Reduce unnecessary distractions.
- Where possible, it will also help to address other factors affecting your mobility. This might be pain, tiredness, stress or urinary symptoms. See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages for tips for addressing each of these.
- Ensure you have appropriate footwear. Low heels or flat soles are better, and solid shoes with good support are better. Try to avoid unsupportive shoes, such as flip-flops, floppy slippers, or high heels.
- Think about your posture: Parkinson’s can cause you to stoop, but some of this can be overcome. Try to stand tall and keep reminding yourself to straighten up.
- Think about your movements: Parkinson’s can cause movements to get smaller, but some of this can be overcome. Try to think about big movements, including big steps, lifting your feet off the floor, and keep reminding yourself.

### Environment

- Ensure adequate lighting.
- Try to minimise obstacles, like clutter on the floor or trailing cables.
- Consider the surface you are walking on – watch out for wet floor or loose rugs.
- Be careful what you lean on – don’t lean on something that might itself fall over or come off a wall.
- Are there patterned surfaces that make it harder to judge distances, for example patterned carpets?
- Consider applying a strip of coloured tape to the edge of steps/stairs. This will highlight them and make it easier to judge the step.
- How accessible are the things that you use regularly?

### Safety

- Recognise your limits.
- Have a back-up plan – how could you get help if you ran into trouble? This might be for example, keeping your mobile phone in your pocket.

## Equipment and Aids

Some people need equipment or aids in order to continue tasks of daily life.

**It is strongly recommended that you see a physiotherapist and occupational therapist to advise on these.**

</div>

Before purchasing equipment, consider the following overall tips below:

- Consider how and where you will use the equipment
- Try the equipment before you buy it
- Ensure the fit of the equipment is as correct as possible
- Remember that companies selling equipment could be biased. Health and Social care professionals do not have a financial incentive so are impartial.
- The <a href="https://www.dlf.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disabled Living Foundation (DLF)</a> is a charity (not commercial) that provides detailed information about equipment, including places you can try it out and comparisons of products.

### Walking sticks

- Walking sticks are suitable for some people but not for others. It is best to be assessed by a physiotherapist.
- Some people find them helpful for specific circumstances, e.g. in crowds or for longer outings
- A benefit may be that others around can see that you need more space
- There are many different styles:
  - Wooden
  - Metal - folding, collapsible, three or four-footed
  - Footed sticks – note these are often heavier
  - Nordic poles – lightweight, thin
  - Sticks with seats attached – note these are often heavier  
    Note heavier sticks may be more difficult to walk with.
- The fit of the walking stick is very important. Size should be checked when you are wearing your regular footwear. You should consult a physiotherapist but as a rough guide:
  - Standing with your arms relaxed by your side, with a slight natural bend at your elbow:  
    The height of the stick should typically be at the level of your wrist crease.
- Buying a walking stick
  - You may be able to borrow or get one for free through the NHS
  - They can be bought at mobility shops, some large pharmacies, or online.

### Walking frames

- Walking frames are suitable for some people but not for others. It is best to be assessed by a physiotherapist.
- Walking frames redistribute weight from legs to arms and come in different types.
- They give a higher level of support than walking sticks
- Zimmer walking frame, or non-wheeled walking frame
  - Pro: very stable
  - Con: person has to stop and lift frame after each step
- Wheeled walking frames
  - Can have two, three, or four wheels
  - May have small, hard wheels (lighter, and better for smooth surfaces); or larger, tyre-style wheels (better for outdoor & rougher surfaces)
- Other features to consider:
  - If it has a basket or seat and where they are located
  - If it collapses and if it will fit through doorways at home, on the bus, in the car
  - If it will be easy to push, and if it can easily ‘get away’ from you
  - Brakes – how they work and if your hands have any difficulty using them
- The fit of the walking frame is very important. You should consult a physiotherapist but as a rough guide:
  - Standing with your arms relaxed by your side, with a slight natural bend at your elbow: The frame hand grips should typically be at the level of the wrist.

### Wheelchairs

- Some people need to use wheelchairs to get around. It is best to be assessed by a physiotherapist to consider other options first.
- It might be for occasional use, e.g. bad days, or longer outings, or frequent use.
- There is a lot to consider when selecting a wheelchair. Wheelchair services can provide more guidance. Considerations include:
  - Your mobility, posture, height and weight, sight, perception, etc.
  - The person pushing a manual wheelchair has to be fairly physically fit
  - For more frequent use, you should have a full seating assessment by a professional.
- You can be referred to the wheelchair service by your GP or another healthcare professional.

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I mean, I can still walk around the house without using a stick. I use a stick when I walk outside. When I’m really on, I wouldn’t need it. But it’s one of those things whereby it flags to people that you’ve got an issue”
