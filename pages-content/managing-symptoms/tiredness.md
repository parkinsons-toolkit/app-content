_Tiredness_ affects everyone now and then. It tends to have an obvious cause, such as poor sleep.

Tiredness often goes away with rest.

_Fatigue_ is more than simple tiredness. It can affect people in different ways. Sometimes it can be mild. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming. You may have a lack of energy and exhaustion. It can go on for a long time and impact day-to-day activity.

Fatigue affects up to half of people with Parkinson’s. The exact cause of this is unknown but lots of factors can contribute.

_Daytime sleepiness_ is falling asleep or feeling like you might fall asleep during the day.

## What might be causing it?

There are lots of possible causes.

Parkinson’s itself can cause fatigue and sleepiness, and fatigue may be an early symptom. In addition, drugs used in Parkinson’s can cause sleepiness. Tiredness can also occur when the medication wears off. This is noticed before the next dose is due.

Another common cause of fatigue or tiredness are stress or feeling low, which can impact on sleep. See our page on _Low Mood and Anxiety_. Sleep problems due to other causes can also impact on daytime tiredness. See the page on _Sleep disturbances_.

Less common causes of fatigue include some medical problems such as anaemia, diabetes or thyroid problems.

If you suddenly feel very tired or lacking in energy this may indicate that you are unwell from something else such as an infection. However, in this case you would probably have other symptoms too, e.g. fever.

## What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try for yourself as below. But there are instances where you should seek professional help.

See your GP if:

- You feel constantly tired for more than 4 weeks.
- You are tired and feeling unwell.
- You are very bothered by your tiredness.
- You have also lost your appetite or lost some weight.

You should see your GP or contact your Parkinson’s specialist team if:

- You have started falling asleep during tasks.
- Your symptoms have come on since starting a new Parkinson’s medication.

If you are falling asleep during tasks, it is important to consider your safety. You must not drive and should consider other scenarios (e.g. baths) where falling asleep unexpectedly could be dangerous.

There are some simple strategies that may help. You may have tried some of these already.

### In day-to-day life

- It may be helpful to think about what aspects of your life are tiring. Are there any triggers you can avoid?
- You might need to pace yourself more. To help with this think what it is most important for you to achieve that day. Try to focus on this.
- Bigger tasks can be broken down to something you think you can finish that day.
- Be realistic, most things can wait for another day.

Further strategies are seen below; not all will be applicable to you.

**If you are tired at work:**

- Try to take regular breaks when you work.
- Discuss how this can be achieved with your employer, who must make suitable adjustments.
  - See <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons
    /practical-advice/work-and-caring" class="internal-link">_Work & Caring_</a> for more advice.

**If you are at home:**

- Try and pace yourself throughout the day. Take breaks when you feel tired.
- Schedule important tasks for when you feel less tired.
- Do what you can yourself but recognise when you have difficulty.

### Napping

- A short nap (e.g. 20-30minutes) can help during the day, especially after a meal, and reduce fatigue.
- However, it is important to get the balance right as frequent napping can make sleeping at night more difficult.
- If you get fatigued after meals, you can try lighter meals at lunchtime.

### The role of exercise

- Fatigue can cause people to be less active and the less active you become, the more tired you feel.
- We know keeping active is good for people with Parkinson’s. It can help fatigue, mood, sleep and general health.
- Do as much as you can handle; it can be as simple as chair-based exercises. See <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons
  /optimising-wellbeing/staying-active" class="internal-link">_Staying Active_</a> for ideas.
- If there is a pattern to your tiredness, plan to exercise regularly at times you have a bit more energy.

### Healthy Body and Mind

- Keeping the mind active can help, for example keeping up hobbies or things you enjoy.
- As well as a healthy balanced diet, a small snack every few hours may help your energy levels.
- There is no evidence that multi-vitamins or ‘tonics’ help if you have a good healthy diet.
- Drinking too much alcohol can affect quality of sleep and make you tired.
- See the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/sleep" class="internal-link">_Sleep Difficulties_</a> page for more advice on getting good sleep.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “With Parkinson’s, I use my energy wisely. I think to myself, what’s more important for me to do today. And I’ll put my energies there.”
>
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “It varies how I feel. If I don’t feel too good, I’m on the couch resting to get my energy levels up. I don’t push the body to do things that I know that I can’t. If I’m tired, I just stop. And I just wait until I feel better, then perhaps if I’ve not been out all day, I’ll go for a little brisk walk or something and get some fresh air and do that instead. Yes, the body kind of like tells you what to do rather than you tell it.”
>
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “I love entertaining. I love cooking for people and having people in the home. But I’ve got to pace myself. I mean that’s just partly my age as well as having Parkinson’s. But I know that if we had a lot of people in and, if I’m having people around for dinner, I’ve got to make sure I’ve got a quiet day either side and I’ve got to plan ahead. So I’ll lay the table a couple of days before and I’ll try and shop and do a lot of the preparation before I actually have people round”

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They might ask** about a wide range of things if you see them for tiredness. This includes:

- Sleep
- Medications
- Weight changes
- Day time napping
- Thirst
- Passing urine a lot
- Mood
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Skin changes
- Appetite
- Bowel changes
- Alcohol consumption

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- You could monitor your symptoms for 3 days. Record when you feel tired and when you take your drugs to see if there is a relationship. You could also record how much you are sleeping at night or in the day.

### Tests

These depend on their assessment. They may run further tests such as blood tests, urine tests or scans. Your doctor may do a blood test for anaemia, a vitamin or iron deficiency, diabetes or thyroid function.

## Further Treatments for Tiredness and Fatigue in Parkinson’s

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your drugs.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**

**Some drugs wused for tiredness in Parkinson's:**

- If your sleepiness is thought to be due to medications, these may be changed.
- If the tiredness is thought to be due to wearing off of your Parkinson’s drugs, they may change your regime to give more cover.
- Sometimes a drug called modafinil is used. But it is only started by specialists and needs regular specialist review.
- If tiredness is thought to be due to other causes, including low mood or sleep problems, treatment for these may be recommended.

**Some drugs can make tiredness worse:**

- Dopamine agonists, such as Mirapex® and Requip®. Your specialist may reduce the dose Or switch to another drug.
- Opiate pain killers (e.g. codeine, morphine)
- Allergy drugs e.g. piriton
- Relaxants- benzodiazepines e.g. diazepam
- Some antidepressants (e.g. mirtazapine)
- Some pain medication (e.g. amitriptyline)
- Some heart/blood pressure drugs (beta blockers, e.g. atenolol)
- Some drugs for fits (e.g. phenytoin, clonazepam)
- Some cancer drugs.

For most drugs causing drowsiness, combining them with drinking alcohol will make it worse.
