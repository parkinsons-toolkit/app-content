Loss of interest or drive is sometimes called _apathy_. It is not the same as feeling low or depressed, although loss of interest can also be part of depression. Sometimes to an outsider, apathy can even be confused with laziness, but it can in fact be a symptom of Parkinson’s. For some people apathy mainly affects their engagement with activities such as hobbies or pastimes. For others it can affect more routine day-to-day activities such as taking care of themselves.

There are times when we all avoid doing things because they are too difficult. However, this is not the same as apathy. Apathy is when a person <ins>can</ins> do something, especially when encouraged by others, but does not do so if left to themselves. They are not avoiding it – simply they have no wish to do it or cannot make a start. If you feel like you have lost your spark, or can’t be bothered to do anything:
that might be apathy.

## What might be causing it?

Apathy is a symptom of Parkinson’s as well as other neurological conditions. There is evidence that it is linked to the levels of dopamine in the brain. This link is different from how we know dopamine affects movement. Apathy in Parkinson’s can be present by itself. It can also be linked to low mood, memory and thinking problems.

## What should I do about it?

The feeling of apathy can be hard to change. There is no quick fix, but you should routinely talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team about it so they can assess for a cause and potentially treat related symptoms.

Even if your interest and drive is low, it is important to remain active. Managing apathy as well as you can is good for your mental and physical health, and can help the people that you live with. There are some changes you can make that can help you deal with apathy (see section ‘What can I try for myself?’).

There are three main ways to tackle apathy. First, by establishing a routine so that the activity becomes more of a ‘habit’. Second, by building a menu of things that you can select from to do. Third, by agreeing with other people that they are allowed to remind or prompt you when you are not being active.

### Establishing a Routine

Apathy tends to affect activities that we do less often, especially where we can choose to do them or not. Regular activities and habits tend to be less affected. Building a regular routine within the day or across the week is a good way to tackle apathy. This can also improve your mood. Your routine can include anything that you want, but the best routines have some variety. It is useful to think of a number of activities that you can do from different categories.

**Chores**
There are always things that need doing about the house, in the garden or wherever. These may be things that you have done in the past but have stopped doing. There may be other chores that a family member does that you could take over or help with. These may not be fun but they are useful and often provide an opportunity for some physical activity. You may want to sit down with people in your family to work out what chores you can do and agree a time when they will be done.

**Hobbies and Pastimes**
When a person has apathy, hobbies and pastimes are often one of the first things to be affected. Sometimes these have become difficult because of Parkinson’s. Even if you cannot do all the things you used to enjoy, find a few that you can still do and build one or two of these into your routine.

For more advice, see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/hobbies-and-pets" class="internal-link">_Hobbies & Pets_</a> page.

**Physical Activity**
Apathy tends to lead to physical inactivity and that has consequences. While it is important for everyone to keep active, it is especially important when a person is apathetic. Even if they are able to get up and move around, they may spend much of their time sitting. Chores, hobbies and pastimes can offer chances to be more active. You can also build in a small amount of exercise into your routine.

For more advice, see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> page.

**Social Activity**
Think about what chances you have to be around others –family, friends or members of organisations and groups that you belong to. Apart from unscheduled social activity such as phone calls, try to plan at least 2 or 3 activities each week. These could include going to an organised external activity, calling a friend or having tea with a neighbour. If you do these things at roughly the same day and time each week it will make them easier to do. It may be possible to combine social activity with hobbies, pastimes and exercise.

### Make a ‘menu’

There will be times when it feels like you have nothing to do, or do not want to do things that need doing. For someone with apathy it can be hard to think of options. It is often useful to make a menu of things to do. Making a choice from alternatives is easier than deciding from scratch. Don’t have too many things on the menu but try to have some variety, with options from the range of activities described above. Avoid activities that take too long, are complex or involve too much planning.
Someone with apathy may either not start or be unable to finish them.

### The importance of prompts and reminders

One of the key features of apathy is that a person tends not to do things if left to their own devices. Routines and menus can help, but usually there is a need for prompts and reminders. Family members can sometimes be reluctant to do this, perhaps because they don’t want to ‘nag’. However, this is important in apathy. Prompts and reminders may involve talking through the planned routine for the day, or encouragement to look at the menu if activity seems to have stopped.

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- How is your mood?
- Have you noticed any changes in your memory or thinking?
- Are there times when you feel like yourself and engaged, and other times when you feel disinterested and can’t be bothered? Or is it continuous?
- Have you noticed any relationship with your medication?

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- It can be that you have difficulty remembering when it is a problem. If so, you could make a note of it in the diary in the days or week before your appointment.
  - However it is not likely to be helpful to closely track over a prolonged period (e.g. more than a week)

### Tests

It is usually not needed to take tests to assess apathy.

## Further Treatments

- At this time there are not a lot of treatments, such as medication or special therapy, for apathy itself.
- It can be that apathy is related to depression. This means treatment of depression (e.g. therapy or antidepressant medication) may help.
- It can be that the apathy is related to memory or thinking problems. This has been shown to improve with the medication used for these problems (cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine).
- Your healthcare team may be able to advise where to find groups that offer support.
- It can be that apathy is impacting your daily living and so you need more practical support. Your GP may then refer you to the community occupational therapy team. You can also contact your local social services for a Needs Assessment.

## Key Messages

- Apathy can be a symptom of Parkinson’s, linked to mood or thinking problems. It can also happen on its own.
- You can have a structured routine, make choices easier, and provide prompts and reminders.
- These are important to manage apathy.
