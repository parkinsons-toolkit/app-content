Reading, Writing and Technology
Introduction
Reading, writing, and using technology may be more difficult for people with Parkinson’s. This can
be due to a combination of factors, and we will explore each issue in detail below.
Reading
Why can it be difficult with Parkinson’s?
Eye movements involved in reading are highly complex and must be coordinated in order to track
words on a page.
- Saccadic eye movements are the rapid eye
movements that allow the eyes to quickly jump to
a new target. These are important for the eyes to
jump to a new line on the page. In Parkinson’s,
these movements can be slow, and it can be hard
to find the right spot on the next line to continue
reading. These eye movements can also become
fast if you are experiencing dyskinesias.
- Vergence eye movements are the eye movements needed for seeing an object up close or far
away. These eye movements are important when focusing on a near task, like reading. In
Parkinson’s, vergence eye movement can be impaired resulting in the person experiencing
double vision.
- Other eye problems that can make reading difficult include:
- Slowing of eye lid movement. This means less blinking which can cause dry or irritated eyes
or even blurring of vision.
- Spasms of the eyelid muscles can cause involuntary eye closure, called blepharospasm.
- Some medications used in Parkinson’s can cause dry eyes.
What can I try for myself?
For dry eyes, over-the-counter ointments and eye drops are available from pharmacists; they can
be very helpful.
What else may be helpful?
Have regular eye checks to see if there are problems with near vision as this
tends to deteriorate as people age. If a regular eye check is normal or new glasses are prescribed
and you are still having problems reading, you may wish to ask your GP, optometrist, or
ophthalmologist for a referral to a neuro-ophthalmologist. A neuro-ophthalmologist can do
further tests and may prescribe ‘prisms’ (a special kind of glasses).
See our 5 Senses page for more information on visual changes in Parkinson’s.
Writing
Why can it be difficult for people with Parkinson’s?
You may find writing more difficult if you
experience:
- Slower movement of hands
- Increased stiffness in the hands
- Decreased dexterity in hands - harder to
grip and move a pen or pencil
- Decreased stamina for writing
- Tremor
What can I try for myself?
- Trial a fibre-tip or gel ink pen as these flow most easily
- Use a pen grip, wide pen, or a pen with a built-in grip to provide a more comfortable and
relaxed grip on the pen
- To improve the size of your writing, you could try:
- Using lined paper, or darkly lined paper underneath light paper in order to guide
writing o Aiming for the above page line with each upward pen stroke while forming
letters o Concentrating on ‘big and slow’ or ‘smooth and slow’ may help with small
or feathery writing
- Practising hand exercises. In our More Information section you can find a link to a
YouTube video of hand exercises you can try.
First exercise:
- Put your hands straight out in front of you, shoulder-height, with your palms away from
you and fingers extended wide
- Turn your hands towards your face, and pull them back to be even with your body at your
ribs, making a tight fist with your hands at the same time
- Make a fist as you bring your hand in and extending your palm as you extend your hands
out.
Repeat this 20 times.
Second exercise:
- Tap each finger on your right hand to your right thumb and then extend upwards. Do the
same on your left hand at the same time.
- Explained in detail: Tap right pointer finger to your right thumb and your left pointer finger
to your left thumb, then extend both pointer fingers to the sky; then tap middle fingers to
each thumb, and extend each middle finger to the sky, etc.
- Repeat this exercise twice on each finger.
Third exercise:
- Curl fingers down so that the nail area of fingers are touching where the base of the fingers
connect to the palm of the hand
- Then extend fingers up and out as wide as they can go
- Curl and extend 20 times – include your thumb in the curling and extending.
What else may be helpful?
If your handwriting does not improve despite trying the above suggestions, you could try seeking
the advice of an occupational therapist. An occupational therapist can give you more specific hand
exercises that may help with writing and other specialised hand tasks. For a referral for
occupational therapy, speak to your GP.
You can also consider:
- If you have difficulty writing your signature on documents (prescriptions, passports,
banking, etc.), a facsimile signature stamp may be useful. This can be used to create a legal
signature with a rubber stamp meaning the person no longer needs to physically write
their signature.
- Alternative ways of communicating (e.g. using a computer).
Using Technology
Computers
If you struggle to communicate by speaking or writing,
you could consider using equipment that may reduce
these challenges - like a computer or tablet. But, you
may find it challenging to use these if you have a lot of
tremor or stiffness.
What can I try for myself?
- If you use a laptop and find typing on a standard keyboard difficult, try typing on a touchscreen (e.g.
tablet or mobile phone).
- Video call software can be easy to use with little typing needed. E.g. Zoom, Skype, Facetime, Google
Meet.
- You can use talk-to-text software to send messages to friends or family. Talk-to-text means you push
a button, talk, and the program takes your verbal words and records them as written words.
This means you don’t have to type anything.
If using a computer or the internet feels overwhelming, there are training courses available (see More
Information for contact details).
- Age UK may offer a computer training course near you
- Online Centres Network is made up of many organisations, with the mission to provide access and
advice on computers and the internet. They have 6,000 centres around the UK.
- You could ask at your local library to see if they offer computer training opportunities.
If you decide to purchase a computer or a tablet, consider which may suit your needs better…
Tablet:
- Uses touch screen control to select options or type
- Talk-to-text may be more readily available
- Light weight and easily portable
- Likely has a camera for video calls.
Laptop:
- Uses touch pad and possibly a mouse to select options
- Has a keyboard
- Might not have talk-to text readily available
- Not as lightweight or as easily portable
- Likely has a camera for video calls.
Desktop computer:
- Uses mouse to select options and keyboard for typing
- Might not have talk-to-text readily available
- Not portable or lightweight
- May have a camera for video calls.
‘Which?’ is a not-for-profit, independent service that provides unbiased advice to consumers for
a fee. They can help with a wide range of areas, including choosing what technology devices to
buy. They also provide information on technological aids in later life, such as assistive technology
and easy-to-use mobile phones. Visit their webpage for more details. You can find the link in the
More Information section.
Mobile Phones
Why can it be difficult for people with Parkinson’s?
- Decreased hand strength for holding a phone
- Tremor
- Softer voice may make it more difficult to be heard
- Decreased stamina for holding the phone
What can I try for myself?
- Hand exercises to increase strength and mobility may be helpful for holding a phone.
- See hand exercises in the section “Writing”.
- An occupational therapist can provide more specific exercises to complete.
- Exercises to increase your voice volume or make your speech more clear may help you in
conversations.
- Speech therapists can identify what areas you could work on and give you exercises to
practise at home. For a referral to a speech therapist, speak with your GP.
- Voice Analyst: an application (app) for your mobile phone or tablet. It allows you to
measure the volume and pitch of your voice. Can bring to speech therapist appointments
to share your progress and results.
- There is a fee to download this app.
- See more information on apps below.
- Singing in a choir, practising singing in the shower, or holding a note long and loud may all
be helpful – using your voice is important.
What may be helpful about a mobile phone?
- Mobile phones can offer peace of mind. For example, knowing
that you can contact someone straight away, no matter where
they are.
- Smartphones (a mobile that acts as a small computer and
connects with the internet) can have applications (‘apps’)
downloaded onto it. Apps are pieces of
software that can be used to perform specific tasks.
Examples: writing a note, playing a game, or letting you know when your bus is coming.
Smartphones have many different features that could be useful, including the following:
- Voice activation (either built-in on the phone or available as an app). This can allow you to:
- Call someone in your phonebook by saying their name
- Search the internet
- Dictate text messages and emails
- Open apps
- Record notes as reminders o Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers: allow a
nominated person (like a partner, family member or carer) to see on a map where you are. You
need to be carrying your smartphone and it needs to have service in order for this to work.
- Video calling: lets you see and hear each other during a call o Medication manager apps:
remind you when your medication is due. They may also let you store medical information.
- Data gathering apps. These are used to measure some movement symptoms
and speech. They may be used to inform the person who adjusts your Parkinson’s
medications or treatments

Travel
Introduction
This section aims to provide the key information that you should
think about when travelling. This will include key issues around
driving and parking. It will also include other options for getting
around and advice for travelling abroad.
Driving
Being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease does not automatically mean you have to stop driving.
However, there are a number of things that you need to think about to make sure that you and
others are safe on the road.
What should I do?
It is a legal requirement to tell the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) of your medical
condition as soon as possible. It is a criminal offence to not tell the DVLA of a medical condition
that may affect your driving. Not telling them could result in a fine of up to £1,000 or prosecution
if you are involved in an accident. It is also important to discuss your medication with your
Parkinson’s specialist team or GP and how this may affect your ability to drive. This could be, for
example, drowsiness, or feeling too sleepy in the daytime. Not declaring a health condition would
mean your motor insurance is not valid. It is an offense to withhold information from your
insurance company and so they should also be notified. See the Legal Matters page for more
information about insurance.
Will my GP or specialist talk with the DVLA?
You will need to inform the DVLA, as this is not something your healthcare professionals can do.
Healthcare professionals are only allowed to share your personal medical information with your
consent, or if or if there is thought to be a public safety risk. This would be if they think you are
unsafe to drive, for example. If, in such a situation, you continue to drive, they are required to
break confidentiality and notify the DVLA. The DVLA may later ask for further information from
your Parkinson’s specialist or GP with your permission as described below.
How do I inform DVLA?
There are two ways to tell the DVLA:
1. , One option is to report your condition online on the gov.uk website: GOV.UK
2. , The second option is to report your medical condition by completing the “Medical fitness to
Drive” (PK1) form. This can be completed online (GOV.UK) printed and sent via the post, using
the address on the form. If you need a paper copy or more help, contact the DVLA driver medical
enquiries line:
tel: 0300 790 6806
