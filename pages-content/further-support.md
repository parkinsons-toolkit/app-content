and latest research updates. It also offers the ‘First Steps’ course for people newly
diagnosed with Parkinson’s.
Cure Parkinson’s Trust
The Cure Parkinson’s Trust is a smaller UK based charity which is dedicated to
supporting research to slow, stop and reverse Parkinson’s. Whether you are
interested in taking part in research yourself or just wanting to keep up to date
with developments, this is a good place to look.
GOV.uk
GOV.uk is where you can find information regarding government policies and your local
services. Any updates in law changes or policies will be found on the government website.
NHS
The NHS website (www.nhs.uk) provides the latest information regarding research
and treatments for Parkinson’s. Local NHS services can also be found using the
website.
Apps
An app is a type of software that
allows you to perform specific
tasks. These can be downloaded
to your mobile phone or other
electronic device. There are
some apps designed to help you
deal with your day-to-day
symptoms of Parkinson’s. It is
difficult to know if an app is
useful based on good scientific
knowledge and they may be discontinued. However, below are some
examples of apps that you may find useful.
‘Our Mobile Health’
Our Mobile Health is an organisation made up of health professionals and experts
that review and identify the best health-related apps to be used by people. Our
Mobile Health worked with Parkinson’s UK to provide a list of recommended apps:
•

  Electronic devices

  How to know if information is reliable
  Some of the above may be classed as medical devices. Medical devices are devices
  that are intended to be used for medical purposes. When looking for medical
  devices that you think may help you, it is important to see if the product has been
  assessed by the government. In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products
  Regulatory Agency (MHRA) will test medical devices. If the device is judged to be
  satisfactory and given approval then the device will be marked with “CE”. If you
  see any products with the “CE” mark then you can have confidence that it has
  been assessed and approved by the government.
  If you are looking for apps that could be useful, it is recommended to either try
  the NHS app library or ‘Our Mobile Health’. Be cautious about just using
  commercial app stores. If looking for information on the internet be cautious
  about carrying out general internet searches and using information from any
  website. Try getting your information from known reliable sources such as the
  websites and charities mentioned above.
  Remember that each person diagnosed with Parkinson’s will experience the condition
  differently.
  This means that not everything you read will apply to you. It is always worth
  talking with your GP or the health professionals around you to discuss what
  information, devices, websites or apps they feel may help you.
  If you have any tips please tell a member of the study team or email
