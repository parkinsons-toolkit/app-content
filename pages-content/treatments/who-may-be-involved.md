# Who May Be Involved?

Parkinson’s care often involves a **Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT)** approach, meaning multiple healthcare professionals work together to manage your care. As such, you may come across a wide range of professionals, and the team members you meet will depend on your individual needs and condition.

Throughout your Parkinson’s journey, your health professionals, including your GP or specialist, may ask for other professionals to be involved in your care. This will vary between individuals living with Parkinson’s depending on the symptoms and challenges they experience. Read on to learn more about which specialists maybe involved if you need them.

## Specialties: What's what?

### General Practice (GPs)

Your first point of contact for health concerns.

- They have a broad remit. They provide your general medical care, whether that be a new illness, a long term one, or preventing illness. This includes physical and mental health for people of all ages.
- They are responsible for the coordination of your care, e.g. make referrals to specialists when required.
- They hold your main medical records (other services should send summaries to your GP).
- They issue you with prescriptions for most medications (some are only issued by a specialist).
- They can signpost you to free services in the area that may help your health and wellbeing (social prescribing).

### Parkinson’s Specialist Teams

It is recommended that people with Parkinson’s have a named specialist doctor. This will be a doctor responsible for the care of their Parkinson’s. They are often based in a hospital, though there is variation in who provides this.

- **Neurologists:** A doctor with a focus on conditions affecting the “nervous system” (e.g. the brain, spinal cord and nerves).
- **Geriatricians:** A doctor with a focus on the care of older adults.

For both of these, there can be some doctors that have a sub-specialty focus and expertise. This could be in Parkinson’s and related conditions, _Movement Disorders_. It is recommended that people with Parkinson’s have a regular and stable point of contact. This would be a trusted source of information specific to Parkinson’s. In many teams this would be provided by a specialist nurse.

- **Parkinson's Disease Nurse Specialist (PDNS):** This is a nurse specialist practitioner who can assess and manage symptoms of, and medication used in Parkinson’s. They can provide advice and support, with timely responses to problems. Some PDNSs can prescribe medication. Some of them but not all will make home visits as part of their role, usually when they are community-based, whereas others can provide care during a hospital admission, usually when they are hospital-based.

### Other Specialties

There are more than 60 specialties, but the following are the more common specialties to be involved. They may be based in hospitals or in community services:

- **Accident & Emergency (A&E):** Broad remit as this can include people of all ages with any condition. Their expertise lies in the emergency and urgent aspects of care. Part of this involves determining where someone is best treated, e.g. in hospital or at home.
- **Neurosurgery:** Specialists in procedures on the nervous system (e.g. the brain, spinal cords, and nerves). Some advanced treatments used for Parkinson’s involve brain surgery. This would be done by Neurosurgeons.
- **Urology:** They are specialists in the urinary tract, including bladder, prostate, kidneys and the tubes between them. They may be involved for example, for problems with bladder control.
- **Psychiatry:** Specialists in mental health so may be involved, for example, for problems with mood or memory.
  - Note _psychiatrists_ are clinical doctors (have a medical qualification). This is different from _psychologists_ as described above (have a psychology qualification), but they often work together.
- **Palliative Care:** Sometimes called 'supportive care', they are specialists in symptom control, for a range of different health conditions. The aim of palliative care is to help you to have a good quality of life. o They also have expertise in care in later stages of life, but palliative care is <ins>not</ins> just about end of life.

## Organisational Level

In the UK, there is a split between **_Healthcare_** (National Health Service, NHS) and **_Social Care_** (or Social Services). Note the financial comments apply to people living in the UK (those with “ordinary residence”). There may be a charge for overseas visitors. See the NHS website for more details on who is in entitled to NHS services.

### Healthcare

- This is free at the point of access.
- It provides prevention, control or treatment of illness, injury or disability, and care of these. This can be:
  - GP check-up
  - Hospital care
  - Physiotherapy
- In healthcare, services are split into o Primary Care. This is the first point of contact, i.e. your GP or an A&E.
  - **Secondary Care:** This is hospital and community care. It can be planned, urgent or emergency. It follows a referral from primary care.
  - **Tertiary Care:** These are very specialised services, e.g. neurosurgery. This follows a referral from secondary care.
- Some services are commissioned at a national level. Others can be at a local level. This means there can be differences in services by area.

### Social Care

- This is financially assessed. It depends on your income and savings.
- It provides assistance with day-to-day activities and social interaction. It promotes independence and contribution to society and protects vulnerable people. This can be:
  - Carers coming to your home to help you wash and dress
  - Supported living environments
  - Assistance with home adaptations
- There are some cases where provision for social care needs are covered by the NHS. This is known as _Continuing Healthcare (CHC)_. Please see the Finances page for more information.

## Private Healthcare

- There are many options for healthcare through the private sector.
- The waiting times are often shorter, but there is a fee. This can be substantial if you are not covered by a private insurance plan.
- If you are due to be referred to another service and would prefer to go privately, do tell the person making the referral.
- Some private services are covered by private health insurance. If you are unsure, contact your insurance provider to find out what is covered.
- In most cases, to access private services and have this paid under insurance, you still need a referral from your GP.
- Accessing private healthcare does not stop your entitlement to NHS healthcare, but they must be separate. The NHS does not subsidise private healthcare.
- If you do chose to pursue private healthcare, here are a few considerations:
  - Ensure they are the profession that you are seeking, for example:
    - Dietitians and nutritionists are not the same.
    - Psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not the same.
  - Look up the expertise of the provider. For example, does a private doctor have specialist expertise in Parkinson’s?
  - Check that the provider is registered.
    - Most healthcare providers are legally required to be registered with a regulatory body as listed for each profession above.
    - The Professional Standards Authority holds a list of accredited voluntary registers which they have independently assessed against their own standards. They cover professions that are not regulated by law, such as psychotherapists.
  - Review the reports for the provider by the _Care Quality Commission (CQC)_ – website below.
  - Some professionals work across both NHS and private services whereas others just work in one.
- More information is available on the NHS website.

### Private Social Care

As indicated above, social care is not necessarily provided as a free public service. To request a Needs Assessment, Contact your local council Adult Social Care department. If care is recommended, they will conduct a Financial Assessment. This determines if the council will contribute to the cost or not.
