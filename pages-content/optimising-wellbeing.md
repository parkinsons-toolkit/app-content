# Optimising Wellbeing

- You could enter your activities to the Symptom & Activity Tracker to
  keep a record.
  This can also help you see which times are better for you than others.

6. Reflect: If something is not going as you’d hoped, think about why. What could you do differently?
   You might need to break it down into even smaller steps to make progress.
7. Reward: If it’s going well, reward yourself.
8. Forming a habit: If you want to do something on a regular basis, you want to make it automatic,
   like a habit. This takes persistence over time. For most people it takes about 3months for a regular
   activity to become a habit. To help:

- You could try associating the task with something that is already part of your routine, like
  brushing your teeth, or watching a scheduled TV programme. This gives an anchor.
  The My Wellbeing section in your manual will guide you through this process.
  Keeping Active
  Research studies have shown broad benefits of
  exercise in Parkinson’s. Activity is good for many
  aspects of life:
- Mobility
- Reducing falls
- Mood
- Sleep
- Bowels
- Overall health, including cardiovascular health Image: Freepik.com

It doesn’t have to be a chore. Many people wonder how much and what type of activity they
should do. They may wonder how to achieve it alongside their Parkinson’s. This will be different
for each person. You may have questions after reading through the information below. If so,
please speak to your physiotherapist, your GP or your Parkinson’s team. You should be cautious
about suddenly significantly increasing your activity levels, particularly if you have other health
conditions such as heart disease. If you are considering a drastic lifestyle change, discuss with a
healthcare professional first for advice.

Think of your activity and exercises to be like your medication. It is an essential part of treatment
for your Parkinson’s. This advice is for everyone. The sooner activity is part of your life, the better.
What is “Keeping Active”?
In general, the more active you are, the better. It is important not to go beyond your limits.
However, you should feel like you are pushing yourself.
Different people will reach this with different activities. This will change over time.

- If the activity no longer challenges you, then step it up.
- If the activity has become too much, then roll it back.
  Everyone with Parkinson’s should be considered for referral to physiotherapy. This is even if you
  do not have trouble with symptoms. It can be helpful to tailor the recommendations about
  activity for you.
