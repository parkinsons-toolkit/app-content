Variability of symptoms occurs when people with Parkinson’s change from having good, consistent control of their symptoms to having less consistent, less predictable control. This change in control may happen slowly over time or may be more of a sudden change.

A medication dose may not last as long as it did it in the past. People refer to this as the medication ‘wearing off’. Some people notice their tablets don’t ‘kick in’ right away after taking them. Others notice their medications don’t work as smoothly as they did before.

People may have times in between doses where they don’t feel as well. This variability of symptoms is referred to as ‘on’ and ‘off’ times:

- Being ‘on’: when you are moving, thinking, and feeling well.
- Being ‘off’: when you are not moving, thinking, or feeling well These refer to movement or ‘motor’ symptoms (e.g. tremor, slowness, and stiffness) and ‘non-motor’ symptoms (e.g. anxiety, low mood, sweating, and restlessness).

For some people, the variability is predictable and in relation to medication. For others, the variability does not follow a pattern, and this can be very challenging to manage.

## What might be causing it?

No one knows for sure why variability of symptoms - or motor fluctuations - occurs. Researchers think it’s related to the way levodopa stimulates the brain. They usually occur after a person has had Parkinson’s for a longer time. Fluctuations are also more common with higher doses of levodopa. Illness or infection unrelated to Parkinson’s can make you feel unwell and lead to changes in your symptoms. This is different to the ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods described above.

## What should I do about it?

There are things you can try for yourself (described below). You should discuss with your Parkinson’s specialist team things you can try. Medicine adjustments may be possible.

### Make the most of ‘on’ time

- Make the most of time when you are feeling ‘on’ and schedule your activities for these times.

### Plan ahead

- Some people find that their off periods are worse after an exhausting day. Plan ahead so you can rest after you have had an exhausting day, if you experience that.

### Manage Stress

- Stress can increase the variability of symptoms, so finding ways to stay relaxed even when stressed can be helpful.
- Complementary therapies such as massage, acupuncture, and aromatherapy may be helpful.
- See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/mood" class="internal-link">_Mood_</a> page for more information.

### Medication-Meal Timing

- If you notice medications aren’t working as quickly or smoothly as before, consider taking them a while before meal times (e.g. 30 minutes before).
  - This is particularly applicable when having high protein meals. Protein is an essential part of diet and is important for tissue healing and overall health. It should be a part of everyone’s daily diet.
  - Some people find that taking their levodopa 30 minutes before their protein meal allows their medication to kick in before they start eating.
  - If taking levodopa on an empty stomach causes nausea, try taking it with fruit or crackers rather than high protein foods.
- See <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/eating-well" class="internal-link">_Eating Well_</a> for more information about diet.

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “What I usually do is I’ll sit back and I’ll [..] take deep breaths and then I just sort of think, ‘calm down, just calm down’, you know, and sort of bring myself back again.”
>
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “We talked to him about changing his medication around, which he did do, and he took them a little bit earlier in the evening so he would feel a little bit more able.”

## Further assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- The timing of the fluctuations in your symptoms (for example when you feel ‘off’ and how long for).
- How you feel at the different times (e.g. stiff movements, or low mood) o Your current medication in detail (including what you take, when, and how) and how you feel your body responds to the medication.

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- This is particularly useful for variable symptoms. It can help you and your specialist understand how your medication affects you, how often you are having difficulties, and guides medication adjustment.

Try to monitor your symptoms for about 3 days. Types of things you could record include:

- When you feel ‘on’ and ‘off’
- When you take your medication
- When you eat your meals
- Any other symptoms, such as <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/involuntary-movements" class="internal-link">_Dyskinesia_</a> or <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/freezing" class="internal-link">_Freezing_</a>.

## Further Treatments

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**

**They might ask:**

- Longer-lasting medications for Parkinson’s (e.g. long-acting levodopa preparations, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors or COMT-inhibitors like entacapone).
- Dividing your current total dose of levodopa into smaller, more frequent doses.
- Adding additional “rescue” doses of antiparkinsonian medication, e.g. dispersible levodopa preparations which act quickly.

### Referral

- You may be referred on to another service.
- There is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you.
- If the variation in symptoms is causing difficulty with daily activities, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team may refer you on to an occupational therapist. They can assess if you might benefit from extra equipment or support.
- If your Parkinson’s specialist has tried all medication options and the variability is still having a significant impact on your daily life, then other options may be explored. This usually involves a referral to a specialist centre. Some alternative options:
- Apomorphine, a dopamine agonist delivered by injection either intermittently or as a continuous daytime infusion. See <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies/medications" class="internal-link">_Medication_</a> page for more information.
- Deep brain stimulation or Duodopa (a gel given by a tube directly into the gut). See our <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments_</a> page for more advanced therapies.

## Key Messages

- Variability of symptoms involves going from having consistent, good control of your Parkinson’s symptoms to less consistent, less good control over symptoms. This includes both movement and non-movement symptoms.
- This includes ‘wearing off’ of medication and changing between periods of better control (‘on’) and less good control (‘off’).
- There are things you can try yourself to help with variable symptoms. Your Parkinson's specialist team should also be able to suggest options which may help.
