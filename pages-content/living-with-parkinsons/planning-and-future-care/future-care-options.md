# Future Care Options
Planning for the future when living with Parkinson’s can feel overwhelming, but having a plan in place can ease stress for both you and your loved ones. Making decisions early gives you more control over your care and helps ensure that your wishes are honoured as the disease progresses. 

Future care planning often includes two important tools: **Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)** and **Advance Decisions (Living Wills)**.

## Accepting Help

It is very common to fear needing help, or losing independence. In many cultures, independence is sought after throughout life. Some people consider needing help an embarrassing or depressing prospect. Others live in denial that they need help. 

A more positive approach to this learning is to:
- Change the things that can be changed
- Accept the things that cannot be changed
- Learn to distinguish the difference.  

This is not always easy. It requires: 
- Reflection
- Self-evaluation
- Being honest with yourself.

There are many people who can support you with this. Consider the people in your life, personal or professional. Who might be able to listen and offer insight? However, remember someone else’s viewpoint may not be right for you. 
 
You may find it easier to accept help if you also think about things you can do for yourself. Try to make sure that people around you know this too. This will help them understand your decisions and will help you stay in control. 
Asking for help can be hard. Remember many people want to help. 

### Who might be able to help?

This depends on what you need. Some professional options:
- Your Parkinson’s specialist team
- Your GP team
- Community therapy services
- Social services
- Palliative care teams
- Citizens Advice Bureau

Also consider charity services, such as the Parkinson’s UK helpline, or Age UK.

See the <a href="/learn/further-support/further-support" class="internal-link">_Further Support_</a> pages for more ideas.

## Decisions About Your Care

Decisions can be hard. Many people need support in making big decisions. There are also many reasons why someone may be unable to make decisions for themselves. Parkinson’s can affect the ability to make decisions. Anyone could find themselves in a situation that prevents them making their own decisions. This could be following an accident, for example. These considerations are therefore not only relevant in Parkinson’s, but are for _everyone_.

### Who do you want involved in decisions about your care?
Think about:
- Who knows you well?
- Who could represent your views?
- Who do you consider wise?

Share your thoughts and views with these people.

## Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)

An LPA allows you to legally appoint someone you trust, such as a family member or close friend, to make decisions on your behalf if you’re no longer able to. 

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/power-of-attorney.jpg" alt="power-of-attorney" class="example-class">


There are two separate types of LPA, one for **health and care decisions** and another for **financial matters**:
- **Health & Welfare LPA**: An LPA for Health & Welfare would become your voice if you were unable to make health and care related decisions.
- **Property & Financial Affairs LPA**: Manages money, property, and financial matters.

Having an LPA in place means that, if the time comes when you need help making choices, someone who understands your preferences can step in. This can relieve a great deal of stress for you and your family, knowing that someone is prepared to act in your best interests.

If you were unable to make these decisions yourself and did not have an LPA, then professionals take this responsibility. The decisions must be made in your _best interests_. Professionals are obliged to try to find out what your wishes would have been. To do this, they will look for any recorded wishes and will speak to people close to you.

## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences. 

> “LPA for Health & Welfare is as, if not more, important than LPA for property and financial affairs, so if you have an LPA for property and finances, why not your health?”

## Recording your wishes: Advance Care Planning
The components of advance care planning include an ‘Advance Decision’ and an ‘Advance Statement’ of wishes: 

An **Advance Decision** is a legal document also known as a 'Living will' or an ‘Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment’ (ADRT). It sets out a person’s wishes to refuse specific medical treatments under specific circumstances. It allows a person to refuse particular ‘life-sustaining treatments’ as covered below. However, it is not possible to elect to refuse ‘basic care’ such as nursing care or food and water by mouth. An **Advance Decision** is legally binding, so it must be written carefully with explicit wording and signed in the presence of witnesses. An **Advance Decision** can be especially important if you’re unable to communicate your decisions in the future. By having a Living Will, you’re helping your family and healthcare professionals understand and respect your choices.

An **Advance Statement** is a record of your wishes around any aspect of your future health or social care. It is not legally binding in itself, but if you were unable to make decisions it must be taken into consideration. 

Things to consider in an **Advance Statement**: 
- Who should be involved in decisions around your care?
- Spiritual, cultural or religious thoughts and beliefs
- Where do you want to be?
- Wishes and choices for daily life
- Views on medical interventions
- Wishes for after death (see the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/planning-and-future-care/end-of-life" class="internal-link">_End of Life_</a> page for more on this).

## Why Future Care Planning is Important

While it can be emotionally challenging to think about future care, making these decisions early can provide peace of mind. It reduces uncertainty for both you and your loved ones, allowing them to support you in ways that align with your values. Having these discussions also helps avoid last-minute decisions during times of crisis, when emotions are high.

## How Family and Friends Can Support
Family and friends play a crucial role in future care planning. They can:
- **Join you in conversations** about your wishes, ensuring they understand what’s most important to you.
- **Help with practicalities** like gathering information on care options or assisting in setting up an LPA.
- **Provide emotional support**, reassuring you that they are there to respect your decisions and stand by you through the journey.

It’s also important for caregivers and family members to look after their own well-being. Dealing with the emotional aspects of Parkinson’s can be tough, and resources like the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/for-family-and-carers" class="internal-link">_Guidance for Families and Carers_</a>  pagr offer support in managing stress, anxiety, and other challenges that come with caregiving. 

There are also **peer support networks** where both people with Parkinson’s and their loved ones can connect with others in similar situations. You can explore the <a href="/learn/further-support/services-and-groups" class="internal-link">_Services & Groups_</a> page for more information on helpful services and communities.

By planning ahead, you and your family can face the future with greater confidence, knowing that your care will reflect your personal wishes and that you have the support you need.

## What if more support is neededed?

If a person is finding day-to-day tasks more difficult, they may benefit from: 
- Carers to help support with daily tasks
- Changes to the home environment or relocation
 
The <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page has more information and advice about day-to-day tasks. The <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page has more information and advice about where you live and adaptations that can be made to a home. Your local Adult Social Care services can support you in working out what is best for you. You can find your local services by searching on the GOV.UK of NHS websites, or calling your local council. 
In broad terms the options are: 

### Own home or family home
- Extra equipment to help you with daily life, such as a commode or bed lever.
- Adaptations to your home, such as stair rails or a walk-in shower.
- Carers visiting your home to help you with your personal care. As a rough guide, Adult Social Care   services may be able to provide up to two carers visiting four times per day, depending on your needs. 

Home support can be arranged privately or via your local Adult Social Care services, or a combination of both. Use of private care services does not exclude help from Adult Social Care services: a combination can work really well to help you to personalise your care. Adults Social Care Services can arrange for Occupational therapists and physiotherapists to visit your home to work out what equipment and adaptations they would advise with no obligation. Some equipment and adaptations can be provided free of charge and for others financial support may be available depending on your needs and circumstances. 

For some people who need frequent or more complex help, a change in living environment may be a good option. 

### Charge housing
There are different types of places to live, with varying levels of support: 
- Sheltered Accommodation
- Assisted Living or Extra-Care Sheltered Accommodation
- Residential Care Homes
- Nursing Care Homes 
 
A change in housing could be arranged privately or via your local Adult Social Care services. 

### Who pays for this?
Also see the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/appointments-and-hospital-stays" class="internal-link">_Finances_</a> page for more advice. 

In the UK at this time: 
- **Healthcare**, from the NHS, is free for those eligible to access it.
- **Social Care** is ‘means tested’ in that a financial assessment determines how much (if any) is charged. 

### Adult social care services
- Find your local services by searching on the NHS or government websites service directories. Listed as _Adult Social Care_.
- They provide support for your daily life activities. This may be through living arrangements, equipment or carers.
- They will carry out an assessment to decide what you would benefit from and the cost.
- The financial thresholds change with time. Check online at gov.uk or ask your social worker.
- There are different arrangements that can be made around payment. Some people prefer to have more control. Others prefer to have payments directly managed by the Social Care services. 

### Continuing healthcare
NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) delivers complex levels of care when necessary and is paid for by the NHS/state. It covers the full cost of care for those who meet the criteria, based on health needs. This is typically in a situation of very complex healthcare needs. Parkinson’s itself does not make someone eligible for NHS Continuing Healthcare, but they may be eligible if they have complications and other healthcare conditions. Since health needs change over time, the eligibility can also change. CHC is coordinated through the Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). You can look up your local CCG in the Service Directory on the NHS Website. 
 
There is a rather complex assessment process to decide if someone is eligible. It considers: 
- What help is needed
- How complex the needs are: Are multiple specialist medical professionals required?
- How intense the needs can be:
  - Is specialist medical care required frequently?
- How unpredictable the needs are:
  - Are frequent changes in decisions surrounding care needed?
  - And is the patient able to contribute to these decisions? 

In general, there is an initial checklist stage. This is to identify people who should have a full assessment. This checklist is available to the public on the government website. It is completed by a health or social care professional. 
If a full assessment is advised from the checklist, then the case will be assessed in more detail. This will be by a team (minimum of 2) of different professionals. . This should also take into account your views and the views of people involved in your care. 

If you are found to be eligible, the recommended care will be fully paid by the NHS. It cannot be ‘topped up’ as such. The next step is to arrange the care. You should be involved in the planning of this care. It may require a change from your current arrangement. If you have concerns about the suggested change, speak to your Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). The Continuing Healthcare (CHC) is reviewed regularly since situations change. 

More information is provided on the NHS website. An organisation called ‘Beacon’ also gives free independent advice on NHS continuing healthcare (details at the end of this section). 
 
For people with rapidly deteriorating health who may be nearing the end of life, there is a Fast Track process. This bypasses the usual complex CHC assessment process, but of course does have its own eligibility process. It is designed to ensure individuals in this situation are supported with the required care as quickly as possible. Your health and social care professionals should be able to advise further if needed. 

### NHS-funded nursing care 
This funding is also from the NHS/State. It is for people who are assessed as _not eligible_ for the Continuing Healthcare (CHC) funding described above, but do need registered nursing care in a care home. It is a contribution rather than the full cost and is the same rate across England. You can contact your local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) or ask your health or social care professionals for more information.

## Medical Decisions


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/future_care_remote_consultation.jpg" alt="remote-consultation" class="example-class">

### Medical decisions about food & drink 
- Provision of food and drink by mouth is considered ‘basic care’, so will always be provided.
- Some people have difficulties swallowing. If this becomes severe, the risk of food or drink going into the lungs instead of the stomach increases. Swallowing difficulties are also associated with the risk of inadequate nutrition and weight loss. See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/planning-and-future-care/progression-of-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Progression of Symptoms_</a> page for more explanation.
- Changes to the consistency of food and drink may help with swallowing, but in some cases swallowing remains difficult and the risk of pneumonia and inadequate nutrition remain high.
- If these risk remain, the options are:
  - Continue eating and drinking by mouth, accepting the risks. o Stop eating and drinking by mouth, and use tubes to deliver food, drink and medicines.
- Swallowing is assessed by ‘Speech and Language Therapists’. They can advise on what is best from a medical perspective.
- **However, each person can make the decision not to have tube feeding, if they are unable or refuse to eat and drink.**

When tube feeding is used due to swallowing problems, it is to **_replace_** eating and drinking by mouth. It is important to note that saliva will still form and can still _go down the wrong way_. So overall the risk is reduced but not gone. In _other_ circumstances, such as some stomach problems, tube feeding may be done alongside eating and drinking. 
 
Tubes for food, drink and medicines also carry risks so there is no perfect solution. The risks and benefits will vary from person to person and require careful consideration. Speech & Language Therapists, specialist dietitians, doctors and nurses are all likely to be involved in this decision. Consideration must be given to quality of life. For many people, food and drink are a source of pleasure. This is discussed further in the 'Health & Care Priorities' section below. 

Tubes for food and drink are sometimes called ‘Artificial Nutrition & Hydration’:
- **Intravenous fluid:** Fluid can be given through a small drip into a small vein, such as in the arm or hand. It must be done cautiously as affects the body’s usual regulation of fluid intake.
- **Nasogastric (NG) tube or nasojejunal (NJ) tube:** These are tubes inserted through the nose that goes down into the gut. This is to deliver food, water and/or medicine directly. 
- **Gastrostomy – (sometimes called ‘PEG’ or ‘RIG’):** These are tubes inserted by a surgical procedure. This sometimes involves a camera being inserted from the mouth (endoscopic guided) and sometimes involves special x-rays (radiologically guided) to guide placement. The tube connects from outside the body, through the skin into the stomach. The tubes can be used for food, water and/or medicine. Sometimes the tube is extended on the inside to reach into the small intestine (sometimes called PEG-J). This is the same method as for Duodopa, discussed on the <a href="/learn/treatments/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments_</a> page.
- **Intravenous nutrition:** In very specific circumstances, liquid food can be given through a big drip into a big vein (such as in the neck). Food given in this way has significant risks related to it. It is therefore only undertaken in very special circumstances, such as for people whose bowels don’t work.

In general, people are awake for insertion of drip lines and NG or NJ tubes. Gastrostomy insertion usually involves local anaesthetic injection into the skin and sedating medicine via a drip.

Small drips and NG/NJ tubes are **short-term options**. The insertion can be uncomfortable or even painful but most people get used to them once they are in. Sometimes they become dislodged and need to be re-inserted. There is a very small risk of infection or bleeding from these procedures.

Gastrostomy tubes are longer term, but involve a more invasive procedure and higher risk of complication. This can include infection. They too can sometimes become dislodged and need to be re-inserted. They can also be distressing if someone becomes confused or has a cognitive impairment.

### Medical decisions about medication

All medicines have risks and benefits. This can be a tricky balance. It varies between individuals and changes over time. Medicines play different roles:
- Some are for treatment of life-threatening illness, such as antibiotics for serious infections.
- Some are to improve symptoms, such as Parkinson’s medicines.
- Some are to prevent problems in the future, such as cholesterol-lowering medicines.

The decision about which to take should consider what the medicine is for, the potential side effects, and the requirements to give it (e.g. if it needs a hospital admission to give via a drip). As such, potentially beneficial medicine may not be used if the risks outweigh those benefits.

Note: Oxygen is also a medicine and must be prescribed. It has risks and benefits, so the same principles apply.

A person may make the decision that they no longer want to go to hospital for medical care. This may mean that they make the decision that they are happy to have tablet antibiotics, which can be given at home. However, they may decide not have antibiotics which must be given directly into a vein, which would normally require hospital admission.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/medical-decision.jpg" alt="medical-decision" class="example-class">


### Medical decisions about critical care interventions
Critical Care Interventions are those which are given for life threatening illness, in a closely monitored hospital environment. There are various different machines that are used in certain circumstances to treat critical illness. The machines are designed to do the role of the body organs that are not working properly. Examples include:
- **Support for breathing:** This may be using a tight-fitting mask that pushes air in and out of a person while they are awake (‘Non-invasive ventilation’). Or it may involve having a tube put down from the mouth into the lungs (‘Intubation’) for air to be pushed in and out, whilst the person is sedated (‘invasive ventilation’). 
- **Support for the kidneys:** This may be using a machine a bit like a dialysis machine. The person is connected to the machine by a tube, like a big drip line. Blood is taken out from the person into the machine, which clears out waste, and then the blood returns to the person. 
- **Support for heart and circulation:** There are special medicines that must be given via big drip lines with close monitoring to support the heart and circulation. Very occasionally even more specialist machines are used to pump blood around the body. 

These machines do not cure the underlying problem. They support the body functions, giving time for the body to fight (e.g. fight an infection), or for direct treatments to take effect (e.g. antibiotics). The machines themselves put the body under a lot of stress, in addition to the stress caused by the illness. As such, they do not work for all medical problems. This is a more invasive approach than usual hospital care, so has a greater chance of causing distress. 
 
The decision to whether to undertake these critical care interventions is therefore a complex one. Such decisions should involve experienced professionals. Carers, and those close to someone who is undergoing such treatments, should not feel solely responsible for such decisions. 

### Medical decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) refers to a combination of medical interventions that are used for person whose heart and/or breathing have stopped, known as ‘cardiac arrest’ or ‘respiratory arrest’. This includes ‘chest compressions’, ‘ventilation’, medicines and potentially ‘defibrillation’. Alongside these, treatment is given to address the reason for the heart or lungs having stopped. 

Interventions used during CPR:
- **'Chest compressions'** involve repeatedly pushing up and down hard on a person’s chest, either by hand or a machine. The aim is to circulate blood while the heart is not beating.
- **'Ventilation'** involves pushing oxygen in and out of the person’s mouth, either by hand with a ‘bag’, or by a machine. It may be done with or without tubes in the airway. It is to move air in and out of the lungs to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide. 
- **'Defibrillation'** involves electrical shocks being delivered to the heart, usually through sticky pads applied to the chest. Defibrillation is only used in specific circumstances. In cardiac arrest, the heart has stopped beating effectively. In some cases, it still shows signs of activity on a monitor, in other cases all activity has stopped. Defibrillation aims to reset particular abnormal patterns of heart activity and does not restart a heart that has no detectable activity. 
- Certain medicines, given via a drip or into a bone, may be used with the aim of increasing the chance of the above interventions being effective.
- These interventions are trying to minimise further damage to the body whilst a treatment for the underlying cause can be given. As such, if there is no effective treatment for the underlying cause of the cardiac or respiratory arrest, the CPR is futile. 

Contrary to what is shown on TV and films, the chance of getting the heart to beat again is actually rather low. The chance of success depends on many factors about the person’s body and on the reason for the heart or lungs stopping. 

The process of CPR is often complicated by injuries to the body, such as broken ribs or brain damage. As a result, even if the heart and lungs are successfully restarted, there are often new medical problems to address. This tends to involve critical care interventions as discussed above, and recovery is variable. 
 
Considering this, decisions around CPR are not straightforward. The default is to be resuscitated; however, people can choose to have a ‘do-not-resuscitate’ order (DNR), which is a medical order written by a doctor to not apply CPR if the person stops breathing. This is a complex decision to make and should be done with the help and support of an experienced professional. 

### Your rights regarding medical decisions

- A person has a right to decline any medical treatment, assuming:
  - They are able to make the decision, known as having mental capacity. o They are appropriately informed.
  - They take the decision voluntarily.
- If a person is unable to make decisions for themselves (they lack capacity), then the principles discussed above in Decisions about your Care are applied.
- UK law does not give the right to demand a treatment that is not thought to be medically suitable. Professionals may not offer treatments where the risks are considered to outweigh the benefits.
- ‘Advanced Decision to refuse life sustaining treatment’ is a legal record declining potentially life- saving treatment, such as those discussed above. There are specific rules about recording these.
- Good communication with and from healthcare professionals is key to this: talk to those involved in your care.

## Health & care priorities

Decisions about treatment and care are based on weighing up the pros and cons. All options will have potential risks and potential benefits. 
- The **likelihood** of risks and benefits for each option is unique to each person. For example:
  - Some people get more side effects from a medicine than others do.
  - Some people recover and get home quickly following treatment of an infection, some take much longer.
  - Some people have complications of an operation, others don’t. 

But also… 
- The **importance** of the various risks and benefits are personal. For example: o Some people may be really bothered by a side effect of drowsiness, when others are not. o Some people may find injections really distressing, when others might not.
  - Some people may find being away from home for a hospital stay unsettling, when others might not. 
 
Within their expertise, professionals should let you know about the likelihood of the risks and benefits. Since everyone is different, this is a guide rather than precise science. However, the importance of these risks and benefits is personal to you.

### Changes over time
The **likelihood** of the risks and benefits changes over time, in particular based on your health and age. Biologically, people who are older with more health conditions are less likely to recover as well from illness. They are also more likely to get harm or side effects from treatments. 
 
Most people also find the **importance** of risks and benefits changes, i.e. their priorities change. 
- In general, earlier in life most people prioritise length of life. They would be willing to accept higher risks of treatment (such as temporary pain) in order to preserve life.
- Later in life, many people shift to prioritise quality of life. This might mean not wanting a painful treatment, even if it is aimed at giving a longer life.
- When people are nearing the end of life, many prioritise comfort and environment. This may be having loved ones around, rather than medical interventions. 

As such, decisions about treatments change over time. It is helpful to consider your own priorities and let those around you know what these are. As these views change, keep your loved ones and the professionals who are involved in your care updated with your views.
