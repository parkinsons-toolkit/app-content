# Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments

## Apomorphine injections

### What is it?  
Intermittent injections of a medicine called apomorphine (a dopamine agonist). The injections go into the skin, a bit like an epi-pen or insulin pen. The medication works quickly, in 5-10 minutes. It lasts for about 40 minutes.  

### Who is it for?  
You may be able to have this treatment if:  
- You are diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have specific difficulties, such as:  
  - Significant periods where the medication has become less effective, ‘off’ periods.  
- Your symptoms respond well to medication.  

Symptoms that don’t get better with other Parkinson’s medications don’t tend to improve with apomorphine injections either. These may include problems with speaking, swallowing, falling due to loss of postural reflexes, or ‘freezing’ when the medication is otherwise working well (‘on’ periods). These may also include other non-motor symptoms such as apathy, drooling of saliva, constipation, or sleep disturbances, etc.  

- You have sudden and unpredictable changes in your symptoms.  
- “Off” periods that aren’t controlled by other Parkinson’s medications. This might include severe movement difficulties first thing in the morning before the tablet medication kicks in.  
- You do not need more than a certain number of injections per day. If more are needed, a pump may be considered (see below).  
- People (or their carers) are able to give themselves injections (after being trained). If people with Parkinson’s or carers are not able to give injections, an apomorphine pump may be considered.  
- A pump may be able to be supported by a district nurse or another nurse.

### What should I expect from the assessment process?  
Apomorphine injections are a specialised treatment that is only managed by specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital.  

If your Parkinson’s specialist team think it might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a specialist centre. They will usually have a trial of the medication to see if it helps. This is often done in a planned day visit to hospital. You may be asked to take an anti-nausea tablet for three days before the trial. The Parkinson’s nurse or doctor will measure how much medication is needed to improve motor symptoms in order to select a starting dose.  

### What does the procedure involve?  
You will learn and practice how to use the medication. The specialist centre will assess that you or a carer are able to use the injectable pens of apomorphine. You will have a plan for use of the medication going forward.  

### What are the benefits?  
- Apomorphine injections can be a “rescue” treatment. It works quickly and it lasts for a short time. It can be taken if tablets haven’t kicked in yet or have worn off.  
- Apomorphine can improve quality of life. It can allow some people to keep working or continue other activities longer.  

### What are the possible risks or side effects?  
Many side effects of apomorphine are typical for dopamine agonists, and should be discussed with your specialist team:  
- Nausea or vomiting  
  - You will likely be given anti-nausea medication to start a few days before your trial of apomorphine and to continue taking for a short time while using the medication.  
- Sleepiness  
- Hallucinations  
- Problems with blood pressure  
- Changes in behaviour known as ‘impulse control disorders’ (see Impulsive Behaviours)  
- Overuse of medication. This can lead to dopamine dysregulation syndrome.  

### What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?  
When you start apomorphine injections you will be given details for who to contact if there is a problem. This may be a trained community nurse or the team at the specialist centre. You should carry the details of your treatment and your specialist team on you to contact if necessary. If you experience side effects, discuss them with your specialist team as soon as they occur.

## Apomorphine pump

### What is it?  
Apomorphine (a dopamine agonist) is delivered continuously via a small pump. The pump has a small needle which is inserted under the skin. It tends to be given during day time hours and stopped at night.  

### Who is it for?  
You may be able to have an apomorphine pump if:  
- You have problems with involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’).  
- Your tablet medication has stopped working so well. For example, you have multiple ’off’ periods.  

It is not likely to improve people beyond their current best and will not get rid of all motor symptoms. The goal of this treatment is to improve a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It aims to give people a better quality of life.  

### What should I expect from the assessment process?  
Similar to the apomorphine injection process described above.  

### What does using an apomorphine pump involve?  
A new needle is inserted each day. The medication is delivered through the needle, a small flexible tube, syringe and pump. The needle is often inserted into the skin of the tummy or the front of the thigh. Apomorphine is usually infused through the waking hours at a set rate. The pump is then disconnected at night.  

### What are the possible benefits?  
- Once the pump is on a stable dose and you feel well, it might be possible to reduce your tablet doses.  
- You may experience fewer and less severe “off” periods.  
- Apomorphine can improve quality of life. It can allow some people to keep working or continue other activities longer.  

### What are the possible risks?  
The most common risk is skin nodule formation (small lumps under the skin). This occurs in most people with the pump. Things that may help to prevent this are excellent hygiene and proper needle insertion and rotation. Lumps may also be treated using ultrasound. You will also be required to undertake regular blood checks.  

Other possible side effects include:  
Many side effects of apomorphine are typical for dopamine agonists, and should be discussed with your specialist team:  
- Nausea and vomiting  
  - You will likely be given anti-nausea medication to start a few days before your trial of apomorphine and to continue taking for a short time while using the medication.  
- Hallucinations  
- Sleepiness  
- Blood pressure problems  
- Changes in behaviour known as ‘impulse control disorders’ (see Impulsive Behaviours)  

### What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?  
When you start apomorphine pump treatment you will be given details for who to contact if there is a problem. This may be a trained community nurse or the team at the specialist centre. You should carry the details of your treatment and your specialist team on you to contact if necessary. If you experience side effects, discuss them with your specialist team as soon as they occur.

## Deep Brain Stimulation

### What is it?  
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is used in specific cases to treat tremor or other movement problems in Parkinson’s. Electrodes which give electrical impulses are placed in certain areas of the brain. Wires connect the electrodes to a pulse generator, usually implanted in the chest. This pulse generator runs on battery and is set up by a specialist to deliver electrical energy to ease symptoms.  

DBS is not a cure; it does not slow the progression of Parkinson’s.  

### Who is it for?  
You may be considered for DBS if you:  
- are diagnosed with typical or idiopathic Parkinson’s;  
- don’t have significant memory or mood problems;  
- have specific movement problems (motor fluctuations or dyskinesia) despite medication changes;  
- can travel to the specialist centre that looks after DBS. There will be lifelong follow-up appointments; and  
- have symptoms that get better with levodopa. Symptoms that don’t get better with levodopa typically don’t improve with DBS.  

Symptoms that don’t tend to get better with DBS (if they don’t improve with levodopa):  
- Speaking problems  
- Swallowing problems  
- Some balance problems (loss of postural reflexes)  
- ‘Freezing’ that occurs when you are otherwise moving well  
- Apathy  
- Drooling of saliva  
- Constipation  
- Sleep disturbances  
- Low mood  
- Memory or thinking problems

</div>


### What should I expect from the assessment process?  
Deep Brain Stimulation is a highly specialised treatment that is only done at specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital. If your Parkinson’s specialist team think it might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a specialist centre. Please be aware there are often long waiting times before you get an appointment.  

The initial appointment is to see if the specialists think it might be a good treatment for you and to discuss it with you in more detail.  

If they think it could be a good treatment for you, and you wish to proceed, there will be an assessment process at the specialist centre. This is likely to involve:  
- Assessment of your Parkinson’s (‘motor’ and ‘non-motor’ problems), including memory and thinking.  
- Assessment of your response to levodopa.  
- Assessment of your suitability for the surgical procedure and the required scans.  
- Scans of your brain.  

If you have DBS, you will need to have follow-up appointments for many years after surgery. This is for the purpose of programming and battery checks.  

### What does the procedure involve?  
- This procedure is typically done under local anaesthetic.  
- A frame is put around your head, so it stays still.  
- MRI scans are done to map out the head and locate the target areas of the brain.  
- Two holes are made, and electrodes are carefully placed in the target areas.  
- Wires from the electrodes are inserted under the skin. They are not usually connected to the pulse generator until a period of time after the electrodes are placed.  
- The pulse generator is surgically placed on the chest or stomach area.  
- Adjustments to the stimulation of the electrodes tend to be required more frequently in the first few months after surgery.  
- The batteries on the pulse generator will need to be surgically replaced every few years.  

### What are the intended benefits?  
This depends on the area of the brain that is being stimulated. Mostly, the main goal is to increase time spent at your best (‘on’ time). As such, it may improve your ability to carry out day-to-day activities. It is not expected to improve someone beyond their current best, or get rid of all movement problems.  

Other possible benefits:  
- May reduce severe involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’)  
- May reduce time when movements are less free (‘off’ time)  
- May improve the severity of movements during ‘off’ time  
- May reduce the time when movements are freer but troubled by involuntary movements (‘on time dyskinesia’)  

## Potential Risks of DBS

There are potential risks related to:  
- **The surgical procedure**: For example, bleeding in the brain or infection of any part of the device.  
- **The electrodes**: For example, if the electrodes move or stop working.  
  - Slurred or slowed speech  
  - Weight gain  
  - Apathy  
  - Difficulty opening your eyelids  
  - Involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’)  
  - Mood changes  

### What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?  
The specialist centre where you had the surgery will continue your follow-up care. They will provide you with details of your DBS device and contact details in case of any problems. You should carry these details with you so that the specialist team can be contacted in an emergency.  

The settings of your stimulator can be adjusted to provide the best results. Adjustments usually occur in the weeks following your surgery and at follow-up appointments as your requirements change.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:  
> “We always came back to the fact that if we’ve tried medication and I still had problems, there’s the operation. We Googled it and my son found out about it. I didn’t want to have the operation because I thought it was too risky. But then it came to a stage where I thought yes, I have to have that. I had the professor who was really good, and then the Parkinson’s nurse. They were really helpful and kind of guided me, saying, you know, ‘Now’s the time for you to have the surgery because your body is sort of showing you that it’s not lasting enough on the tablets and then surgery’s an option if you want to go for it.’ Because you think, ‘Well I went into every avenue of the pills.’ I saw videos of the operation, of the DBS system.  
> So once I had the operation, you know, I could talk to you now probably longer than before. And now I’m more able to sort of express myself in an easy speech. It’s a bit better since I had the stimulator put in. And then the, doing things without getting tired too much.  
> Like they said, the operation will manage your symptoms and that’s what it’s doing. I’m managing my symptoms better than I was without the operation. They gave me quite a lot of support, the DBS team.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s – 03P)*

## Ultrasound

This method is currently under research for the treatment of tremor. It is not yet available for general use.

## Duodopa Infusion

### What is it?  
Duodopa is a gel form of levodopa that is pumped directly into the gut, where levodopa is best absorbed. A tube is surgically inserted from outside the body, through the skin, into the stomach, and then into the required part of the gut. The tube remains in place long-term, and the person (and/or carer) will be taught how to care for it.  

A pump regulates the amount of medication delivered. The pump is usually worn for 16 hours per day and disconnected for 8 hours. Medication packs are kept in the fridge when not in use.  

### Who is it for?  
Duodopa may be considered if:  
- You have Parkinson’s with significant ‘off’ periods or disabling involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’).  
- Your symptoms respond well to levodopa.  

**Not suitable if you have:**  
- Significant dementia or psychotic symptoms  
- Conditions that make surgery high risk  
- Problems preventing safe use of the pump (unless supported by someone else)  

The goal is to maintain people at their best for longer periods, not to exceed current best function.  

### Assessment process  
Duodopa is a highly specialised treatment only managed at specialist centres. Assessment may involve:  
- Evaluation of symptoms, memory, and cognition  
- Assessment of response to levodopa  
- Surgical suitability  
- Discussion about tube care and medication management  

### Procedure  
- May involve a hospital stay and trial via a temporary nasogastric tube.  
- If successful, a long-term jejunostomy (PEG-J) tube is inserted using:  
  1. Endoscopic guidance from the mouth  
  2. X-ray guidance  
- Local anaesthetic is used for the insertion site; sedation is given via IV.  
- Tablet medications are reduced or discontinued as Duodopa is optimized.  

### Intended benefits  
- Less ‘off’ time, more ‘on’ time  
- Reduced dyskinesia  
- Reduced oral medications  
- Improved quality of life  

### Potential risks  
- Early risks: Pain, site infection, tube detachment  
- Other risks: Tube blockages, skin issues around the tube  
- Long-term risks: Weight loss, low vitamin B12 (can affect nerve function)  

### Follow-up  
Long-term follow-up at the specialist centre is required. You will be given contact details for any problems and should carry them for emergencies.
