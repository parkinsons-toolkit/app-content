Everyone’s experience of Parkinson’s is different. Just because some people experience the symptoms described here does not mean that you will.

In general, over time people may experience more symptoms, but there is no rule about which symptoms or when. For some, the uncertainty about how things will look and feel in the future is one of the most difficult parts of the Parkinson’s diagnosis.

_Progression_ may involve the development of new symptoms or the worsening of existing symptoms. It may include an increasing difficulty controlling symptoms. Here we discuss challenges around progression and some of the more advanced symptoms. For other symptoms see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages.

## Dealing with Progression

- Long term health conditions, such as Parkinson’s, can cause different types of loss: from loss of ability to do things you could did before, through to loss of feeling good about yourself as a person.
- The sense of loss can go on for a long time or occur repeatedly at different times in Parkinson’s as the condition changes.
- Grief is a normal emotional response to any kind of loss.
- ‘Stages of grief’ have been described as including anger and denial. In reality people do not necessarily follow through emotions in such distinct stages. You may experience different emotions at different times, all driven by grief. This can happen even long after you thought you had accepted the situation.
- Grief may also be affecting those around you.
- Sometimes grief can come before the loss. This is known as anticipatory grief. This is where the grieving process occurs due to the expectation of what may come.

### What can be done

It is normal to feel grief. It is helpful to acknowledge your grief. Understanding that grief is normal may be a comfort, as is knowing that there is support around for these feelings. Using the support around you to help you through this grieving process is important.

- Talk to people involved in your life. Helping people close to you to understand your view point will help them to support you more sensitively.
- Talk to people with personal experience of what you are going through. Support groups can be very helpful, though they do not suit everyone. Support groups can be face-to-face, online face- to-face, or online such as Twitter. They can help you to feel less alone. Support groups can also help with the sharing of tips for handling some of the challenges you may be facing.
- If you find your feelings are overwhelming, you could speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist
  team.

> “The more I said, ‘Parkinson’s is doing this,’ you may be more angry and frustrated. But to be able to think that it’s a disease and I’m living with it and I have to go and change my life around it, you sort of understand that I have to accept that, because it’s not going to go away. It’s going to stay there. So it’s better for me to deal with it like that.”

## Progression of Symptoms

Variability of symptoms is common in Parkinson’s: good days and bad days; good hours and bad hours. The progression of someone’s exact symptoms over time is impossible to predict.

But generally, over time, symptoms tend to change:

- Symptoms may be quite mild for a period of time, and not impact one’s daily life
- Eventually, symptoms worsen and/or involve other areas of the body – for example, a tremor of the right hand may eventually increase and/or also involve the right foot. This can happen over many months or years, and may not follow this exact pattern.
- Earlier on, symptoms, particularly movement symptoms, tend to respond well to medication.
- Over time you may experience that the medication ‘wears off’ more between doses.
- Involuntary movements, for example unintended twisting of the shoulders, can also develop.
- Various changes to medication regime can be made in order to ease some of these problems. Changes to the diet might also be suggested. This is also discussed on the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/variability-of-symtoms" class="internal-link">_Variability of Symptoms_</a> page.
- Over time, it becomes harder for people to mobilise, and falls and freezing are more likely to occur
- In the more advanced stages of Parkinson’s, the fluctuations and variability in symptoms can become less clearly related to the medication regime. The changes between good and bad times can become abrupt and unpredictable.
- It is impossible for you or your health care professional to predict exactly how your disease will
  progress and over how much time, because each person’s course is different

### What can be done

Speak with your Parkinson’s specialist team:

- There may be adjustments to medication that could help, or the addition of new medications.
- Depending on your circumstances, there may be other options, such as:
  - Medication by injection, ‘apomorphine’ - see the see our <a href="/learn/treatments/medications" class="internal-link">_Medications_</a> page for more information.
  - More invasive options such as Deep Brain Stimulation – see our <a href="/learn/treatments/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments_</a> page for more information.
  - An operation to put a tube into your gut, so that medication can be given directly into your digestive system – see our <a href="/learn/treatments/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments_</a> page for more information.

However, there may not be any suitable medical or surgical way to improve the pattern of your condition. This means that adapting to deal with the unpredictable symptoms may be required. Many find this hard.

If the symptoms are affecting your ability to undertake daily activities or tasks, then you can speak to your GP. You can ask them to refer you to an Occupational Therapist who may be able to recommend strategies, equipment or support to help you deal with these difficulties.

## Dementia

- Not everyone with Parkinson’s gets dementia. It is more common in people who have had Parkinson’s for a long time, but it is difficult to predict who will develop it.
- The term Cognitive impairment includes a collection of difficulties. These include difficulties with thinking, concentration, insight and memory. Some people have difficulties in these areas but do not have dementia. When there are difficulties in more than one of these areas and they affect daily life: that is dementia.
- Dementia is an umbrella term for a whole range of related conditions: Parkinson’s can cause dementia, but this is different to other types of dementia that you may have heard of, like Alzheimer’s or Vascular Dementia.
- Many people find the idea of dementia very scary. For this reason they avoid seeking help for fear of it, but there are things that can be done to support you.
- Beware of misunderstandings: o Dementia is not just a condition of older or frailer people.
  - The loss of identity that is often portrayed of dementia in the media is not always the case. It is actually less common in Parkinson’s Dementia.
- There is huge variation in symptoms in people. Dementia is sometimes related with changes in behaviour (e.g. agitation), mood (e.g. depression) or perceptions (e.g. hallucinations).
- As for Parkinson’s, a Dementia diagnosis can cause grief.

- See your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team for assessment. Assessments may be conducted by a specialist service, often called a _Memory Clinic_.
- There are medication options that have been shown to improve symptoms in dementia. These are generally started by a Parkinson’s specialist or a dementia specialist.
- Memory clinic services vary by area. They will generally have support services connected to them, or they can give you the details of services that can help you.
- Day-to-day strategies for memory difficulties are discussed on the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/thinking-concentration-and-memory" class="internal-link">_Thinking, Concentration & Memory_</a> page.
- **Prepare:** over time dementia can affect a person’s ability to make decisions. If someone no longer has the ‘mental capacity’ to make decisions about their care, then decisions will be made on their behalf. Prepare by thinking ahead and making your wishes known. You can record your wishes in advance or appoint someone to take decisions for you. See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/planning-and-future-care/future-care-options" class="internal-link">_Future Care Options_</a> page for things to consider, and the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">_Legal Matters_</a> page for the formal process.

## Swallowing Problems & Chest Infections

<div class="video-container">

Swallowing problems are common in Parkinson’s but exist along a range of severity.When swallowing problems are more severe, there is a risk of food, drink or even saliva _‘going down the wrong way’_.

### How swallowing works

- From your mouth and nose there are two tubes going down into the body.
- The tube at the front is for air and goes down to the lungs.
- The tube at the back is for food and drink and goes down into the stomach.
- When it is all working well: When you swallow food or drink, your brain and body carefully coordinate movements. This turns the food or drink into a ball, or bolus, closes the entry to the air tube, and pushes the bolus down the tube into the stomach.
- When it is not working well, this coordination may be lost and food or drink may go ‘down the wrong way’ into the air tube.

**Possible problems:**

- Large solid pieces of food going _down the wrong way_ can cause coughing and choking. This can be very scary, but it is the body reflex to clear the throat. The cough itself is therefore good.
- Smaller solids or liquids _going down the wrong way_ may reach the lungs. Here they can cause a harmful reaction in the lungs, and sometimes infection, called aspiration pneumonia. Recurrent debris and reaction in the lungs can cause scarring of the lungs.
- _Pneumonia_ refers to a type of chest (lung) infection. Symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and fevers.
- In this context aspiration refers to food, drink or _saliva going down the wrong way_, into the airway.

### What can be done

- Guidance for self-help strategies for less severe symptoms is on the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/swallowing" class="internal-link">_Swallowing Difficulties_</a> page.
- If you have not already done so, or if the situation has changed, talk to your GP about referral to a Speech & Language Therapist (SLT) for a further assessment.
- If food or drink makes someone cough, encourage the cough to help clear the food or drink from the airway.
- SLT’s may make recommendations. These may be changes in consistency of the food and drink you take in. Such changes are to reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia.
- There are medical options that could be used for artificial feeding and hydration. However, they do not remove the risk of saliva _going down the wrong way._ Artificial feeding and hydration comes with risks and tube insertion may be distressing.
- Some people prefer to accept the risk of food or drink going down the wrong way, so continue to eat and drink by mouth.
- More information on artificial feeding is on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/planning-and-future-care/future-care-options" class="internal-link">_Future Care Options_</a> page.
