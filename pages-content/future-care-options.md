# Future Care Options

Asking for help can be hard. Remember many people want to help.
Who might be able to help?
This depends on what help you need. Some professional options:

- Your Parkinson’s specialist team
- Your GP team
- Community Therapy Services
- Social services
- Palliative Care teams
- Citizens Advice Bureau

Also consider charity services, such as the Parkinson’s UK helpline, or Age UK.

See the Further Support pages for more ideas.
Decisions about your care
Decisions can be hard. Many people need support in making big decisions. There

are also many reasons why someone may be unable to make decisions for
themselves. Parkinson’s can affect the ability to make decisions. Anyone could find
themselves in a situation that prevents them making their own decisions. This

could be following an accident, for example. These considerations are therefore
not only relevant in Parkinson’s, but are for everyone.
•
•
Who do you want involved in decisions about your
care?
Think about:

- Who knows you well?
- Who could represent your views?
- Who do you consider to be wise?

Share your thoughts and views with these people.
You can legally appoint someone to make decisions on your
behalf if needed. This is called Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA).
There are two separate types:

- Health and welfare

- Property and financial affairs
  An LPA for Health & Welfare would become your voice if
  you were unable to make health and care related
  decisions.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“LPA for Health & Welfare is as, if not more, important than LPA for
property and financial affairs, so if you have an LPA for property and
finances, why not your health?”
If you were unable to make these decisions yourself and did not have an LPA, then
professionals take this responsibility. The decisions must be made in your best
interests. Professionals are obliged to try to find out what your wishes would have
been. To do this, they will look for any recorded wishes and will speak to people
close to you.
Recording your wishes: Advance Care Planning
The components of advance care planning include an ‘Advance Decision’ and an
‘Advance Statement’ of wishes:
An Advance Decision is a legal document also known as a “Living will” or an
‘Advance Decision to Refuse Treatment’ (ADRT). It sets out a person’s wishes to
refuse specific medical treatments under specific circumstances. It allows a person
to refuse particular ‘life-sustaining treatment’s as covered below. However, it is
not possible to elect to refuse ‘basic care’ such as nursing care or food and water
by mouth. An Advance Decision is legally binding, so it must be written carefully
with explicit wording and signed in the presence of witnesses.
An Advance Statement is a record of your wishes around any aspect of your future
health or social care. It is not legally binding in itself, but if you were unable to
make decisions it must be taken into consideration.
Things to consider in an Advance Statement:

- Who should be involved in decisions around your care?
- Spiritual, cultural or religious thoughts and beliefs
- Where do you want to be?
- Wishes and choices for daily life
- Views on medical interventions
- Wishes for after death (see End of Life page for more on this).

For more information on Advance Decisions and Lasting Power of Attorney, see the
Legal Matters page.
What if more support is needed?
If a person is finding day-to-day tasks more difficult, they may benefit from:

- Carers to help support with daily tasks

- Changes to the home environment or relocation.
  The Daily Living page has more information and advice about day-to-day tasks.
  The Housing page has more information and advice about where you live and
  adaptations that can be made to a home. Your local Adult Social Care services can
  support you in working out what is best for you. You can find your local services
  by searching on the GOV.UK of NHS websites, or calling your local council.
  In broad terms the options are:
  •
  •
  Own home or family home
- Extra equipment to help you with daily life,
  such
  as a commode or bed lever.
- Adaptations to your home, such as stair rails or a walk-in shower.
- Carers visiting your home to help you with your personal care. As a rough
  guide, Adult Social Care services may be able to provide up to two
  carers visiting four times per day, depending Image: Freepik.com on your needs.
  Home support can be arranged privately or via your local Adult Social Care
  services, or a combination of both. Use of private care services does not exclude
  help from Adult Social Care services: a combination can work really well to help
  you to personalise your care. Adults Social Care Services can arrange for
  Occupational therapists and physiotherapists to visit your home to work out what
  equipment and adaptations they would advise with no obligation. Some
  equipment and adaptations can be provided free of charge and for others financial
  support may be available depending on your needs and circumstances.
  For some people who need frequent or more complex help, a change in living
  environment may be a good option.
  Change housing
  There are different types of places to live, with varying levels of support:
- Sheltered Accommodation
- Assisted Living or Extra-Care Sheltered Accommodation
- Residential Care Homes
- Nursing Care Homes
  A change in housing could be arranged privately or via your local Adult Social Care
  services.
  Who pays for this?
  Also see the Finances page for more advice.
  In the UK at this time:
- Healthcare, from the NHS, is free for those eligible to access it.
- Social Care is ‘means tested’ in that a financial assessment determines how
  much (if any) is
  charged.
  Adult social care services
- Find your local services by searching on the NHS or government websites
  service directories.
  Listed as Adult Social Care.
- They provide support for your daily life activities. This may be through living
  arrangements, equipment or carers.
- They will carry out an assessment to decide what you would benefit from and
  the cost.
- The financial thresholds change with time. Check online at gov.uk or ask your
  social worker.
- There are different arrangements that can be made around payment. Some
  people prefer to have more control. Others prefer to have payments directly
  managed by the Social Care services.
  Continuing healthcare
  NHS Continuing Healthcare (CHC) delivers complex levels of care when necessary
  and is paid for by the NHS/state. It covers the full cost of care for those who meet
  the criteria, based on health needs. This is typically in a situation of very complex
  healthcare needs. Parkinson’s itself does not make someone eligible for NHS
  Continuing Healthcare, but they may be eligible if they have complications and
  other healthcare conditions. Since health needs change over time, the eligibility
  can also change. CHC is coordinated through the Clinical Commissioning Group
  (CCG). You can look up your local CCG in the Service Directory on the NHS Website.
  •
  •
  There is a rather complex assessment process to decide if someone is eligible. It
  considers:
- What help is needed
- How complex the needs are: Are multiple specialist medical professionals
  required?
- How intense the needs can be: Is specialist medical care required frequently?
  How unpredictable the needs are: Are frequent changes in decisions surrounding
  care needed? And is the patient able to contribute to these decisions?
  See extra information below for more detail.
  In general, there is an initial checklist stage. This is to identify people who should
  have a full assessment. This checklist is available to the public on the government
  website. It is completed by a health or social care professional.
  If a full assessment is advised from the checklist, then the case will be assessed in
  more detail. This will be by a team (minimum of 2) of different professionals. . This
  should also take into account your views and the views of people involved in your
  care.
  If you are found to be eligible, the recommended care will be fully paid by the
  NHS. It cannot be ‘topped up’ as such. The next step is to arrange the care. You
  should be involved in the planning of this care. It may require a change from your
  current arrangement. If you have concerns about the suggested change, speak to
  your Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG). The Continuing Healthcare (CHC) is
  reviewed regularly since situations change.
  More information is provided on the NHS website. An organisation called ‘Beacon’ also
  gives free independent advice on NHS continuing healthcare (details at the end of this
  section).
  For people with rapidly deteriorating health who may be nearing the end of life,
  there is a Fast Track process. This bypasses the usual complex CHC assessment
  process, but of course does have its own eligibility process. It is designed to ensure
  individuals in this situation are supported with the required care as quickly as
  possible. Your health and social care professionals should be able to advise further
  if needed.
  NHS-funded nursing care
  This funding is also from the NHS/State. It is for people who are assessed as not
  eligible for the Continuing Healthcare (CHC) funding described above, but do need
  registered nursing care in a care home. It is a contribution rather than the full cost
  and is the same rate across England. You can contact your local Clinical
  Commissioning Group (CCG) or ask your health or social care professionals for
  more information.
  Medical decisions
  Medical decisions about food & drink
- Provision of food and drink by mouth is considered ‘basic care’, so will always
  be provided.
- Some people have difficulties swallowing. If this becomes
  severe, the risk of food or drink going into the lungs instead
  of the stomach increases. Swallowing difficulties are also
  associated with the risk of inadequate nutrition and weight
  loss. See the Progression of Symptoms page for more
  explanation.
- Changes to the consistency of food and drink may help with
  swallowing, but in some cases swallowing remains difficult
  and the risk of pneumonia and inadequate nutrition remain
  high.
- If these risk remain, the options are:
- Continue eating and drinking by mouth, accepting the risks.
- Stop eating and drinking by mouth, and use tubes to
  deliver food, drink and medicines.
- Swallowing is assessed by ‘Speech and Language Therapists’. They can advise
  on what is best from a medical perspective.
- However, each person can make the decision not to have tube feeding, if
  they are unable or refuse to eat and drink.
  When tube feeding is used due to swallowing problems, it is to replace eating and
  drinking by mouth. It is important to note that saliva will still form and can still go
  down the wrong way. So overall the risk is reduced but not gone. In other
  circumstances, such as some stomach problems, tube feeding may be done
  alongside eating and drinking.
  •
  •
  Tubes for food, drink and medicines also carry risks so there is no perfect solution.
  The risks and benefits will vary from person to person and require careful
  consideration. Speech & Language Therapists, specialist dietitians, doctors and
  nurses are all likely to be involved in this decision. Consideration must be given to
  quality of life. For many people, food and drink are a source of pleasure. This is
  discussed further in the Health & Care Priorities section below.
  Tubes for food and drink are sometimes called ‘Artificial Nutrition & Hydration’. See
  extra information below about the tubes that may be considered.
  o
  Intravenous fluid: Fluid can be given through a small drip into a small vein, such as in the
  arm or hand. It must be done cautiously as affects the body’s usual regulation of fluid
  intake.
- Nasogastric (NG) tube or nasojejunal (NJ) tube: These are tubes inserted through the nose
  that goes down into the gut. This is to deliver food, water and/or medicine directly.
- Gastrostomy – (sometimes called ‘PEG’ or ‘RIG’): These are tubes inserted by a surgical
  procedure. This sometimes involves a camera being inserted from the mouth (endoscopic
  guided) and sometimes involves special x-rays (radiologically guided) to guide placement.
  The tube connects from outside the body, through the skin into the stomach. The tubes can
  be used for food, water and/or medicine. Sometimes the tube is extended on the inside to
  reach into the small intestine (sometimes called PEG-J). This is the same method as for
  Duodopa, discussed on the Advanced & Surgical Treatments page.
- Intravenous nutrition: In very specific circumstances, liquid food can be given through a big
  drip into a big vein (such as in the neck). Food given in this way has significant risks related
  to it. I It is therefore only undertaken in very special circumstances, such as for people
  whose bowels don’t work.
  In general, people are awake for insertion of drip lines and NG or NJ tubes. Gastrostomy insertion
  usually involves local anaesthetic injection into the skin and sedating medicine via a drip.
  Small drips and NG/NJ tubes are short term options. The insertion can be uncomfortable or even
  painful but most people get used to them once they are in. Sometimes they become dislodged and
  need to be re-inserted. There is a very small risk of infection or bleeding from these procedures.
  Gastrostomy tubes are longer term, but involve a more invasive procedure and higher risk of
  complication. This can include infection. They too can sometimes become dislodged and need to be
  re-inserted. They can also be distressing if someone becomes confused or has a cognitive
  impairment.

  Medical decisions about medication
  All medicines have risks and
  benefits. This is can be a tricky
  balance. It varies between
  individuals and changes over
  time. Medicines play different
  roles:
  •
  Some are for treatment of life
  threatening
  illness, such as antibiotics for serious infections.
  •
  Some are to improve symptoms, such as
  Parkinson’s medicines.
  •
  Some are to prevent problems in the future, such as cholesterol lowering medicines.
  The decision about which to take should consider what the medicine is for, the
  potential side effects, and the requirements to give it (e.g. if it needs a hospital
  admission to give via a drip). As such, potentially beneficial medicine may not be
  used if the risks outweigh those benefits.
  Note, oxygen is also a medicine and must be prescribed. It has risks and benefits, so the
  same principles apply.
  A person may make the decision that they no longer want to go to hospital for
  medical care. This may mean that they make the decision that they are happy to
  have tablet antibiotics, which can be given at home. However they may decide not
  have antibiotics which must be given directly into a vein, which would normally
  require hospital admission.
  Medical decisions about critical care interventions
  Critical Care Interventions are those which are given for life threatening illness, in
  a closely monitored hospital environment. There are various different machines
  that are used in certain circumstances to treat critical illness. The machines are
  designed to do the role of the body organs that are not working properly. See extra
  information below for some examples.
- Support for breathing: This may be using a tight-fitting mask that pushes air in and out of a
  person while they are awake (‘Non-invasive ventilation’). Or it may involve having a tube put
  down from the mouth into the lungs (‘Intubation’) for air to be pushed in and out, whilst the
  person is sedated (‘invasive ventilation’).
- Support for the kidneys: This may be using a machine a bit like a dialysis machine. The person
  is connected to the machine by a tube, like a big drip line. Blood is taken out from the person
  into the machine, which clears out waste, and then the blood returns to the person.
- Support for heart and circulation: There are special medicines that must be given via big drip
  lines with close monitoring to support the heart and circulation. Very occasionally even more
  specialist machines are used to pump blood around the body.
  These machines do not cure the underlying problem. They support the body
  functions, giving time for the body to fight (e.g. fight an infection), or for direct
  treatments to take effect (e.g. antibiotics). The machines themselves put the body
  under a lot of stress, in addition to the stress caused by the illness. As such, they
  do not work for all medical problems. This is a more invasive approach than usual
  hospital care, so has a greater chance of causing distress.
  The decision to whether to undertake these critical care interventions is therefore
  a complex one. Such decisions should involve experienced professionals. Carers,
  and those close to someone who is undergoing such treatments, should not feel
  solely responsible for such decisions.
  Medical decisions about cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)
  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) refers to a combination of medical
  interventions that are used for person whose heart and/or breathing have
  stopped, known as ‘cardiac arrest’ or ‘respiratory arrest’.
  This includes ‘chest compressions’, ‘ventilation’, medicines and potentially ‘defibrillation’.
  Alongside these, treatment is given to address the reason for the heart or lungs having
  stopped.
  See extra information below for more details on the interventions used during CPR.
- ‘Chest compressions’ involve repeatedly pushing up and down hard on a person’s chest, either
  by hand or a machine. The aim is to circulate blood while the heart is not beating.
  •
  •
- ‘Ventilation’ involves pushing oxygen in and out of the person’s mouth, either by hand with a
  ‘bag’, or by a machine. It may be done with or without tubes in the airway. It is to move air in
  and out of the lungs to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.
- ‘Defibrillation’ involves electrical shocks being delivered to the heart, usually through sticky
  pads applied to the chest. Defibrillation is only used in specific circumstances. In cardiac arrest,
  the heart has stopped beating effectively. In some cases it still shows signs of activity on a
  monitor, in other cases all activity has stopped. Defibrillation aims to reset particular abnormal
  patterns of heart activity and does not restart a heart that has no detectable activity.
- Certain medicines, given via a drip or into a bone, may be used with the aim of increasing the
  chance of the above interventions being effective.
- These interventions are trying to minimise further damage to the body whilst a treatment for
  the underlying cause can be given. As such, if there is no effective treatment for the underlying
  cause of the cardiac or respiratory arrest, the CPR is futile.
  Contrary to what is shown on TV and films, the chance of getting the heart to beat
  again is actually rather low. The chance of success depends on many factors about
  the person’s body and on the reason for the heart or lungs stopping.
  The process of CPR is often complicated by injuries to the body, such as broken
  ribs or brain damage. As a result, even if the heart and lungs are successfully
  restarted, there are often new medical problems to address. This tends to involve
  critical care interventions as discussed above, and recovery is variable.
  Considering this, decisions around CPR are not straightforward. The default is to
  be resuscitated; however, people can choose to have a ‘do-not-resuscitate’ order
  (DNR), which is a medical order written by a doctor to not apply CPR if the person
  stops breathing. This is a complex decision to make and should be done with the
  help and support of an experienced professional.
  Your rights regarding medical decisions
- A person has a right to decline any medical treatment, assuming:
- They are able to make the decision, known as having mental
  capacity. o They are appropriately informed.
- They take the decision voluntarily.
- If a person is unable to make decisions for themselves (they lack capacity), then
  the principles discussed above in Decisions about your Care are applied.
- UK law does not give the right to demand a treatment that is not thought to be
  medically suitable. Professionals may not offer treatments where the risks are
  considered to outweigh the benefits.
- ‘Advanced Decision to refuse life sustaining treatment’ is a legal record
  declining potentially life- saving treatment, such as those discussed above.
  There are specific rules about recording these.
- Good communication with and from healthcare professionals is key to this: talk
  to those involved in your care.
  Health & care priorities
  Decisions about treatment and care are based on weighing up the pros and cons.
  All options will have potential risks and potential benefits.
- The likelihood of risks and benefits for each option is unique to each person. For
  example:
- Some people get more side effects from a medicine than others do.
- Some people recover and get home quickly following treatment of an
  infection, some take much longer.
- Some people have complications of an operation, others don’t.
  But also…
- The importance of the various risks and benefits are personal. For example: o Some
  people may be really bothered by a side effect of drowsiness, when others are not.
- Some people may find injections really distressing, when others might not.
- Some people may find being away from home for a hospital stay unsettling,
  when others might not.
  Within their expertise, professionals should let you know about the likelihood of
  the risks and benefits. Since everyone is different, this is a guide rather than precise
  science. However, the importance of these risks and benefits is personal to you.
  Changes over time
  The likelihood of the risks and benefits changes over time, in particular based on
  your health and age. Biologically, people who are older with more health
  conditions are less likely to recover as well from illness. They are also more likely
  to get harm or side effects from treatments.
  •
  •
  Most people also find the importance of risks and benefits changes, i.e. their priorities
  change.
- In general, earlier in life most people prioritise length of life. They would be willing
  to accept higher risks of treatment (such as temporary pain) in order to preserve life.
- Later in life, many people shift to prioritise quality of life. This might mean not
  wanting a painful treatment, even if it is aimed at giving a longer life.
- When people are nearing the end of life, many prioritise comfort and environment.
  This may be having loved ones around, rather than medical interventions.
  As such, decisions about treatments change over time. It is helpful to consider
  your own priorities and let those around you know what these are As these views
  change, keep your loved ones and the professionals who are involved in your care
  up dated with your views.

  End of Life
  Regardless of health conditions, for many people, the thought of dying is wrapped
  up in fear and uncertainty. Attitudes are influenced by culture, religion, family and
  our life experiences.
  If you are ready to think about your future, there are some things you can think
  about now. These can be a positive and empowering way to prepare.
  Preparation
  Loved ones
  Are there people you want to see or conversations
  you want to have before you die? This may be
  reconnecting, settling a row or telling someone you
  love them.
  How do you want to be remembered? Some people
  like to write letters or put together memory boxes
  for their loved ones.
  Communicating your wishes
  Towards the end of life it may become more difficult to communicate your wishes.
  Planning in advance can help to make sure your wishes are respected: both for
  your care and for after death.

- Consider writing an Advanced Statement or Advanced Care Plan. This is a record of
  your wishes. If you were unable to express your wishes this must be taken into
  consideration.
- Consider making an Advance Decision. This is also known as Living Will. This is a
  record of wishes to refuse specific medical treatments under specific circumstances.
  When valid and applicable, it is legally binding. If you have one, make sure people
  know where it is kept.
- Consider appointing a Lasting Power of Attorney. This is where you can legally
  nominate someone to make decisions for you. There is a formal process to follow
  which includes notifying essential people. Make sure your loved ones and care
  providers know whom you have nominated.
- A Will is a legal document that expresses how you wish for your property (including
  money and possessions) to be allocated after your death. If you do not have a will,
  there are standard rules that dictate how this happens. Make or check your will and
  make sure that your loved ones know where it is kept.
