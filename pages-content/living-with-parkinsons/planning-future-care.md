# Planning Future Care

Planning Future Care
Thinking about the future can be scary, but one way of dealing with the fear is to
take control and plan for it. Everyone gets older. Anyone can become seriously ill.
The uncertainty of those situations can be less frightening if you have prepared
for them in advance.
“Good Housekeeping”
- Consider and convey your wishes
- Write a will
- Appoint a Lasting Power of Attorney
- Organise your documents
The practical aspects of these topics are discussed in the Practical Advice section
under Legal Matters. Here we provide guidance on things to consider for the
future. There are a lot of reasons why people find themselves unable to make or
share their decisions. In such cases those around them have to take decisions on
their behalf. Whether you have Parkinson’s or not, recording your future wishes is
a way to make sure they can be considered when decisions about your care are
made. Thinking ahead, and sharing your thoughts and wishes with family, friends
and care professionals can help make sure decisions are based on your personal
wishes.
Part of planning for your future may include considering ‘palliative’ and ‘end-of-
life’ care options.
What is palliative care?
Palliative care is treatment, care and support for people with a life-limiting illness.
The aim of palliative care is to help you to have a good quality of life – this includes
being as well and active as possible. It can involve:
- managing physical symptoms such as pain
- emotional, spiritual and psychological support
- social care, including help with things like washing, dressing or eating
- support for your family and friends.
A life-limiting illness is an illness that cannot be cured. You can receive palliative
care at any stage in your illness. Having palliative care does not necessarily mean

that you’re likely to die soon – some people receive palliative care for years. You
can also have palliative care alongside treatments, therapies and medicines aimed
at controlling your illness.
What is end of life care?
End of life care involves treatment, care and support for people who are nearing
the end of their life. It is an important part of palliative care. It is for people who
are thought to be in the last year of life, but this timeframe can be difficult to
predict. Some people might only receive end of life care in their last weeks or days.
This information has been broken down into:
- Progression of Symptoms – things that might happen in more advanced
Parkinson’s, though everyone is different and the symptoms are not certain to
happen.
- Future Care Options – potential decisions that could come in the future if you
were less well so you can consider your wishes.
- End of Life – things you might want to think about to ensure your wishes are
respected at the end of your life.
Progression of Symptoms
Introduction
Everyone’s experience of Parkinson’s is different. Just because some people
experience the symptoms described here does not mean that you will.
In general, over time people experience more symptoms, but there is no rule about
which symptoms or when. For some people, the uncertainty about how things will
look and feel in the future is one of the most difficult parts of the Parkinson’s
diagnosis.
Progression may involve the development of new symptoms or the worsening of
existing symptoms. It may include an increasing difficulty controlling symptoms.
Here we discuss challenges around progression and some of the more advanced
symptoms. For other symptoms see the Symptom Management pages.
Dealing with progression
- Long term health conditions, such as Parkinson’s, can cause different types of
loss: from loss of ability to do things you could did before, through to loss of
feeling good about yourself as a person.
- The sense of loss can go on for a long time, or occur repeatedly at different
times in Parkinson’s as the condition changes.
- Grief is a normal emotional response to any kind of loss.
- ‘Stages of grief’ have been described as including anger and denial. In reality
people do not necessarily follow through emotions in such distinct stages. You
may experience different emotions at different times, all driven by grief. This
can happen even long after you thought you had accepted the situation.
- Grief may also be affecting those around you.
- Sometimes grief can come before the loss. This is known as anticipatory grief.
This is where the grieving process occurs due to the expectation of what may
come.
What can be done?
It is normal to feel grief. It is helpful to acknowledge your grief. Understanding that
grief is normal may be a comfort, as is knowing that there is support around for
