# Services & Groups

resources for if you want more information.
Here we offer some guidance on what sort of support is out there. We also
indicate where to find that help. Options do vary depending on where you live,
but there are some good starting points for everyone.
General Resources
These are resources that are fairly common. If you don’t know where to go for
help, these are a good starting point.
Your Parkinson’s team or your GP

- Note you can record their contact details in the About Me section.
- They are available to help with health related issues and can direct you to other
  services in the area.
- Your Parkinson’s team should know if there are any support groups connected
  with the hospital. They may know about support groups outside the hospital too.
- If you can’t get through to the team you know health advice is available via the
  NHS 111 telephone service, NHS 111 online (111.nhs.uk) downloading the NHS
  App or using the NHS website (www.nhs.uk) However please note that the call
  handler is not usually a clinician and may not have much experience of
  Parkinson’s.
  Your
  local
  council

  council
  This
  includes:
- Adult Social Care – also known as ‘social services’. They conduct Needs
  Assessments. These are the first steps in getting Home Care, equipment and/or
  home adaptations and housing support. This is who you should contact if daily
  tasks are becoming more difficult and you think you need help. Note, services
  •
  •
  are means tested so there may be a cost that is different to healthcare which is
  free on the NHS. However, the assessment and advice is free. They can
  also let you know if you may be eligible for some benefits that are not
  means tested, such as Attendance Allowance. These benefits can help pay
  for extra help. See our Finance page for more details on this.
- Parking and Travel, such as Blue Badge schemes, bus passes, dial-a-ride services
  etc. See our
  Travel page for more details too.
  Your workplace
- If you work, your employer has some
  responsibility for your Health and
  Safety at work. Your employer should
  support you with health issues that
  impact on or are affected by your
  work.
- Check with your manager, Human
  Resources (HR) or Occupational Health
  (OH) department.
- This varies but sometimes includes psychological and physical support. This may
  be counselling and physiotherapy.
- More information about your rights is available at www.hse.gov.uk
- If you are worried about discrimination at work, Citizen’s Advice can help – see
  below.

  Many others are listed throughout our guidance pages for specific issues.

  groups. There are options for people with Parkinson’s as well as family and
  carers.
- Age UK www.ageuk.org.uk Telephone: 0800 678 1602 (line open 8am to 7pm)
  They run many initiatives. These include Living Well Projects, aimed at
  older adults and their families and carers. They are often connected in with
  local council services. They have the telephone advice line and a network
  of local advisors. They are also in partnership with the charity The Silver
  Line, to offer free telephone friendship services.
- Citizens Advice www.citizensadvice.org.uk Telephone: 03444 111 444 (England)

  NHS Patient Advice & Liaison Service (PALS)
- PALS is a body within the NHS that offers confidential advice, support and
  information on health-related matters. They provide a point of contact for
  patients, their families and their carers.
- You can find officers from PALS in your local hospital.
- To find your local PALS office, you can ask your healthcare professional, check
  the NHS website www.nhs.uk or telephone NHS 111.
  Peer Support
  Although it can be a daunting idea, many people find peer support helpful. We
  have heard this from people with Parkinson’s and research has shown the benefits.
  It may be social, emotional or practical support but importantly this support is
  given and received. Sharing experiences can increase your confidence.
  There are different types of peer support:
- Face-to-face vs online
- Group vs pairs
- Some are based around information sharing, such as having talks. Others

are more of a social occasion. Some groups are based around an activity,

such as singing or boxing.
Different groups are aimed at different people, for example:

- Groups aimed at different ages

- Groups aimed at carers
  •
  •

- Groups of people with a shared experience, for example particular health
  conditions
  You could try different groups to find what suits you. See what people say about
  support groups below.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“We had just started, within the church, a group, it’s within the community,
called ‘Brain Fit’… it’s basically an afternoon with board games. Or for those
who don’t want to do board games, there’s crosswords, sudoku or just the
chance to socialise.” (Carer for someone with
Parkinson’s)
“Being in a group where they’re not feeling judged because actually
everyone is going through the same thing as they are, and feeling not
alone. It’s just nice to know that you’re not alone.” (HCP)
“I think Parkinson’s groups are great… they’re great socially. They’re great
in terms of finding out about benefits that an individual may not know
about [and] accessing services … They can be useful at talking about which
specialists people like… also recommending specialist services like physio,
like speech and language therapy… especially non-NHS treatments and
things like psychological support and talking based therapies...” (HCP)
How to find a support group:

- Ask your Parkinson’s team about local support groups they may be aware of.

  Accessing Private Services
  Information about what is provided on the NHS is available on www.nhs.uk. If you
  would like to pursue private services, do check out our tips on the Who May be
  Involved page. In most cases, to access private services and have this paid under
  insurance, you still need a referral from your GP.
  Accessing private healthcare does not stop your right to NHS healthcare, but they must be
  separate.
  The NHS does not subsidise private healthcare.
  Tips for choosing a private service:
- Ensure they are the profession that you are seeking, for example: Dietitians
  and nutritionists are not the same; Psychologists, psychotherapists and
  psychiatrists are not the same. (See details of professional roles on the Who
  May be Involved page).
- Look up the expertise of the provider. For example, does a private doctor have
  specialist expertise in Parkinson’s?
- Check that the provider is registered.
- Most healthcare providers are legally required to be registered with a
  regulatory body as detailed on the Who May be Involved page.
- The Professional Standards Authority holds a list of accredited voluntary
  registers which they have independently assessed against their own standards.
  They cover professions that are not regulated by law, such as psychotherapists.
- Review the reports for the provider by the Care Quality Commission
  (CQC) www.cqc.org.uk/

- Some professionals work across both NHS and private services whereas
  others just work in one.
  Research
  Research plays an important role in increasing our
  knowledge of human health and wellbeing. Taking part in
  research can be an empowering way to take a positive
  step towards understanding how best to treat or manage
  a health condition, such as Parkinson’s.
  This chapter has 2 key sections:-

1. Getting involved in research – describes some reasons people choose to get
   involved in research and details of what this might entail.
2. Different type of research in Parkinson’s giving an overview of the range of
   research in Parkinson’s
   Taking Part in Research Depending on the type of study, by taking
   part in research you may be able to:

- Learn more about a condition that affects you or interests you
- Make a difference now and for future generations by helping to improve
  treatments and people’s quality of life
- Support research for a condition you care about
- Access new treatments
- Take an active role in your own care
  What types of research are there that you could take part in?
  There are different types of research you can take part in. Research studies can
  range from testing new medical treatments or new devices, to carrying out
  interviews or surveys on a whole range of topics. This means there is a choice,
  making it easier for you to find the right study for you.
  Research can take place in various locations, including hospitals, GP practices, and
  in participants’ homes. Studies are increasingly also conducted online or by
  telephone. The amount of time and activity needed to take part in a study can
  also vary. The study may need you to take part on only one occasion, or you may
  have to return for several visits over a longer time.
