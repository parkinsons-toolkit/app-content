# Weight and Appetite Loss

People with Parkinson’s can experience weight loss. Though some people may initially welcome this, excessive weight loss can be bad for both health and wellbeing. Weight loss can be linked to conditions that are not Parkinson’s, and some can be serious. So, it is important that you see your GP if you continue to lose weight.

## What might be causing it?

Causes of weight loss related to Parkinson’s include:

- Practical issues in making food.
- Swallowing problems.
- Increased movements.
- Symptoms that cause difficulties when you shop.
- Practical problems when you try to eat, e.g. coordination or being able to focus.

There are many other conditions that might cause weight loss. This can include loss of appetite with depression, side effects of some medications and various health conditions. If you have lost a lot of weight without meaning to, your doctor may need to check you don’t have a serious health condition, such as a cancer. Some people as they get older have a reduced sense of taste and a lower appetite. As a result, they might eat smaller portions and lose weight. However, weight loss is not a normal part of ageing and should be checked out.

## What should I do about it?

You should contact your GP if you:

- Have **persistent**, **unintentional** weight loss of more than 5% of your body weight (this depends on your weight, but is around 3kg or 7lb) over 6–12 months or less.
- Are struggling to put on weight despite the suggestions below.
- Are worried about your weight loss.

If the above do not apply to you, or whilst waiting for your appointment, there are things you can try for yourself.

- Try to eat 3 meals a day with 2 or 3 high energy snacks throughout the day.
- Aim to eat every 3 hours during the day.
- Try adding extras to enrich your food. This could be cream, skimmed milk powder, butter, grated cheese, oil or honey. These will provide you with more energy.
- Higher energy snack ideas could include peanut butter or avocado on toast, rice pudding, yoghurt or a milkshake.
- Milkshakes or malted drinks can supplement your diet. This could replace a cup of tea or coffee, or have them for a bedtime drink. Make sure these do not replace meals.
- Smoking, as well as being bad for your health, can also suppress your appetite. If you smoke, try not to smoke in the half-hour before your meal.
- Try not to fill up on drinks shortly before or during meals.
- Fresh air can often stimulate your appetite. If possible, go for a brief stroll or go outside for a while before eating. Eating in a well-ventilated room can also help.
- If you’re too tired to cook, use ready-made oven/microwave foods or freeze extra portions of meals when cooking and use another day.
- There are a variety of ways that you can purchase meals such as:
  - Meals-on-Wheels
  - Ready meal delivery services (such as Wiltshire Farm Foods or Oakhouse Foods)
  - Lunch clubs
  - Day centres

Consider what would be convenient for you.

If maintaining weight is difficult because of practical aspects of buying, preparing or eating food then see the Daily Living page for guidance.

## Further assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They might ask about:**

- Appetite
- Change in bowel habit
- Loose stools
- Stomach pain or heartburn
- Vomiting
- Problems swallowing
- Tiredness or energy levels
- Fever
- Night sweats
- Mood
- Rashes
- Lifestyle and diet

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- Showing your healthcare workers a record of your daily intake of food and drink for 3 days can help them decide what to suggest next. If you see a dietician, they may ask for a more detailed record.
- Monitor your weight monthly — it is helpful to have measurements to know how much weight is lost. You can record this in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section.

### Tests

If the cause for weight loss is not clear, they may run further tests such as blood tests or scans.

## Further Treatments

### Referral

Your GP may refer you to another service, depending on your issue:

- A dietician
- A speech and language therapist, if swallowing is a problem
- Occupational therapist or physio, depending on your issue
- You may be referred to other medical specialists. This depends on the suspected cause of the weight loss.

## Key Messages

- There are many causes of weight loss, both related and not related to Parkinson’s.
- Weight loss is seen in Parkinson’s, but it is important that people do not lose a lot of weight. This can have a negative impact on wellbeing and health.
- You can have a lower appetite as you get older, but weight loss is not a normal part of ageing.
- Persistent unintentional weight loss needs investigation by your GP.
