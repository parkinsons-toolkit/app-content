# Complementary Therapies
**Complementary therapies** are a group of therapies that have until recently stood outside of usual Western healthcare. They are becoming increasingly used together with mainstream medicine. An example would be using acupuncture as well as the more usual pain- killing tablets to help lessen discomfort following surgery. 

Complementary therapies are considered different to Alternative Therapies. Alternative Therapies are generally used instead of conventional treatments. An example of this might be using homeopathy or herbal remedies and no conventional medications. These are not discussed here. 

Complementary therapies are generally considered to be holistic. This means they usually include all aspects of physical, mental and emotional health. This is because these are all seen as closely connected. For example, a complementary therapist would look at how a condition affects the whole of someone’s life. They would not just look at a symptom on its own. This might mean that a therapist suggests dietary and lifestyle changes as well as offering a physical therapy. 
 
Complementary therapies are often used to boost physical and emotional wellbeing. Some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of using them.

There are many complementary therapies, and so we cannot provide a complete list. Many complementary therapies have not had rigorous scientific testing, and we are not able to say whether they work or not. It is not possible to recommend or endorse any therapy in particular. Different therapies may work for different people. The following are just some of the better-known complementary therapies available. You may like to look into these further: 
- Acupuncture
- Acupressure
- Alexander technique
- Aromatherapy
- Art therapy
- Cannabis
- Craniosacral therapy
- Massage
- Meditation
- Mindfulness
- Music therapy
- Osteopathy
- Pilates
- Reiki
- Reflexology
- Tai chi
- Visualisation
- Qi gong
- Yoga 
 
Some of these physical therapies, for example Pilates, are used to improve flexibility, strength, posture, and body awareness. Others, like mindfulness, mainly relate to thoughts and feelings. 

### Physical Therapies
Some physical therapies, for example Pilates, Qigong and yoga, are activities that can be carried out alone. They can also be carried out in a group under guidance. These three activities have some variations between them, but all involve stretching, gentle movements, and holding particular postures. They have the aim of improving strength, balance, flexibility, posture and breathing techniques. These are thought to improve general fitness and wellbeing. 

### Therapies that focus on thoughts and feelings
These activities include Mindfulness, Meditation and Visualisation. These can be practiced in a group under guidance, or practiced alone. These three examples have variations between them, but in all cases their practice helps focus the mind. For example, the person practicing mindfulness is encouraged to focus only on the present moment. They pay attention to any thoughts and sensations without thinking about what they might mean or getting caught up in them. A similar example is Visualization. This is a practice of imagining or meditating, with a focus on chosen images. The aim of these practices is to focus the mind. This is instead of getting caught up with unhelpful ways of thinking that we sometimes can do, such as thinking about the past or imagining what the future might be.

### Cannabis
There is growing interest in the use of cannabis-based products for the treatment of health conditions.

Here are some key points to know about cannabis:

- Cannabis and cannabis-based medications can be prescribed for certain conditions, such as multiple sclerosis, but only under very specific circumstances and with very strict criteria to decide if a patient is suitable.
- Currently, there is not enough evidence to support the use of cannabis-based products for Parkinson’s disease. However, several research studies are currently taking place to understand if cannabis could be beneficial for people with Parkinson’s and, if so, how.
- In the UK, Cannabis is classified as a Class-B controlled substance. Having, making, or selling cannabis is illegal; this is due to its potential serious risks to physical and mental health.

## Potential Benefits
As will be discussed in the section below 'How do I know if it is trustworthy?' research studies are helpful in showing if certain therapies can be suggested as being helpful. Few Complementary therapies have been rigorously researched. There is a need for more research. Particularly research into their use by people with Parkinson’s. Some smaller studies have been carried out, and people with Parkinson’s report having found certain therapies helpful. A Parkinson’s UK survey of people with Parkinson’s reported a range of benefits from having used a variety of Complementary therapies. Benefits included a sense of wellbeing, increased relaxation and a sense of control of their condition and symptoms. If you are interested in reading more, please follow the link at the bottom of the page. 

### Complementary physical therapies in Parkinson’s 
The Alexander technique teaches you to be more aware of your body and posture. It also teaches how to move more efficiently. Evidence from a small research study suggests that this technique may help with symptoms of pain, speech, tremor, depression and balance. 
 
There is increasing research looking at the psychological and physical benefits of Qigong and Tai Chi. There are also many published studies about yoga. Studies about yoga suggest that it is a safe and effective way to increase physical activity, strength, flexibility and balance in those with mild Parkinson’s. The health benefits of Pilates are reported as including improving posture, muscle tone, balance and joint mobility. Comments from people with Parkinson’s support that Pilates can be positive.

Massage can be used to reduce stress, pain and muscle tension. It can also be used to help people relax. In a similar way Reflexology is often used to increase relaxation. Reflexology is a type of massage that involves applying different amounts of pressure to particular areas on the feet, hands, and ears. It is also believed by people who practice it that it can help with a wide range of problems, including difficulty sleeping and problems with digestion. A small study suggests that it may help with the wellbeing of people with Parkinson’s.

A review of studies using acupuncture, a therapy which is discussed above, suggests that it might be a safe and useful additional treatment for people with Parkinson’s.

### Therapies that focus on thoughts and feelings 
In recent years there has been an increase of interest in the inter-relationship between the mind and the body. Many of the physical practices described above help with relaxation. In the same way it is increasingly being shown that our thoughts can drive our emotions and behaviours. These in turn can then impact physical health. It has been suggested that practices like Mindfulness can help us better understand ourselves, and this body-mind relationship. Mindfulness is recommended by the NHS as one of the five steps to mental wellbeing. 
 
Meditation, for example, has been used worldwide for thousands of years. Although often thought to be linked with religion and spirituality, it is described as being beneficial to mood and stress. It is increasingly used for health reasons. Research scans of the brain have shown changes in brain activity during meditation. 
It has been suggested that music can improve movement and speech. It can also help people to relax. Some people with Parkinson’s find that listening to strong rhythmic music can improve their walking, prevent hesitations and overcome ‘freezing’ episodes. In general, research suggests that music seems to help people with conditions such as Parkinson’s to improve their emotional sense of wellbeing. 
 
It has been suggested that doing creative activities can help people focus their mind and relax. Doing creative activities can also help people express their emotions in a positive way. Art can also be used this way. Art Therapy is a form of psychotherapy that uses art as a way of communicating feelings and thoughts. Therapies that take place in groups, for example art or music therapy, can be social. Some people can find it supportive to be with others who have the same condition. Group activities in a variety of settings are used to help people relax or talk about their feelings or ideas.

## Potential Risks
Although there is more interest and research into Complementary therapies, there is still a lot unknown. This is particularly so for use by those with Parkinson’s. As there is still a lot unknown about some complementary therapies it is best not to use them to replace the therapies your specialist Parkinson’s team or GP may advise using. If you are thinking of using a complementary therapy, it would be best to first discuss this with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. This is because some complementary therapies might be unsuitable for people with certain underlying medical conditions.

Note some herbal medicines interact with Parkinson’s medications. 
If your healthcare team have no objections and support your use of a particular complementary therapy, it is always worth asking the individual therapist about the potential risks. Also good to ask what steps they will take to avoid any risks.

## My Experience

> “ – my posture is not great. And I felt I wanted to do something for myself. And so, I applied for Pilates. So I contacted a body control Pilates teacher. And she’s been good because she picks me apart and then works on my posture and core stability”.
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “ I find some yoga stretches really help”

## How do I access these? 
Some complementary therapies are available on the NHS. For example, massage, aromatherapy and acupuncture are available through some hospitals, GP practices, physiotherapists, pain clinics and hospices. Osteopathy and mindfulness groups are also sometimes available through referral by GP practices. Some local Parkinson’s UK groups offer relaxation therapies. Some offer regular creative sessions, including art classes. If you are interested in doing something creative an Occupational therapists may also be able to offer advice and suggestions. 
 
If you are caring for someone with Parkinson’s, you may be able to access low cost or free therapies. These may be available through the NHS, local councils and charities in some areas. Many carers find that complementary therapies offer an enjoyable way to reduce stress and have time for themselves. 
GP’s or local Parkinson’s UK supporter may be able to advise. 
 
You may have to pay to see a complementary therapist if the therapy you are interested in is not available on the NHS or through Parkinson’s UK local groups. You may be able to find a suitable therapist through your healthcare professional, or local Parkinson’s UK advisor. Your local council or library may have information about nearby classes. Before enrolling with a complementary therapist, it is worth making sure they are reputable and insured. Where relevant, that they belong to a regulatory body. You should not feel embarrassed to ask them this information, and about their qualifications. The <a href="https://www.cnhc.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Complementary and Natural 	Healthcare 	Council (CNHC)</a> have a register of approved practitioners, which may be a helpful way of finding someone suitable. The <a href="https://www.acupuncture.org.uk/find" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British Acupuncture Council (BAC)</a> has a register of acupuncturists all over the UK who must adhere a strict code of practice to be a member.

### How do I know if it is trustworthy? 
To understand whether a therapy is safe and effective, we need to check the evidence for it. Conventional medications and healthcare products go through a rigorous scientific process. This is to prove safety and effectiveness before they can be prescribed by doctors. This process is managed by the government agency Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This is not the case for complementary therapies. Although more research studies are being done into the effectiveness of complementary therapies they are not tested in the same way. 
 
Unfortunately, not all research studies are large enough to be able to show concrete evidence for how safe and effective they are. When finding out about a therapy and reading the research it is always worth asking questions about the research. This is to make sure you are reading something accurate and not misleading. For example, is the research published somewhere trustworthy? Who has done the research? Is it peer reviewed (checked for accuracy by other researchers)? Did the research include large enough numbers to be able to draw conclusions from the findings? For some complementary therapies it is not possible to ‘prove’ their benefit using this scientific approach, but many people with Parkinson’s report that they find them helpful. 
 
Another way of checking if a therapy is trustworthy is to check the way it is regulated. Just like the safety testing of medications, the practice of conventional Western medicine is regulated by laws. These make sure that practitioners are properly qualified and are guided by standards and codes of conduct. An example is the General Medical Council (GMC) which regulates doctors. A couple of complementary therapies are regulated in a similar way. These are osteopathy and chiropractic treatments. Art therapists and some other practitioners must be registered to practise. This is not the case for all Complementary therapists. This means that standards can vary and there is no responsibility to practice in a particular way. 
 
There have been steps to address this. The Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC) has been set up to be the independent UK regulator for some types of complementary practitioners. This has government support. The voluntary register of practitioners has been approved by the Professional Standards Authority. This is, a body accountable to Parliament. Those registering must have approved qualifications. They must meet standards to remain on the register. Many of the therapies listed above appear on the register. Some are not regulated by law but the therapists can register with a professional body and be insured to work. There are also a number of professional organisations for individual complementary therapies. These govern activities to ensure they adhere to certain standards or codes of practice e.g. Acupuncture Association of Chartered Physiotherapists, The British Acupuncture Council, The British Association of Art Therapists, General Council for Massage Therapies. If you are interested in using a Complementary therapist it is worth finding out if they are members of such associations.
