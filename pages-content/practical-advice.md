# Practical Advice

Parkinson’s can affect day-to-day activities. But, there is lots of support
available and there are many strategies you can try yourself. This section is about being aware of
your options and ‘problem solving’ rather than medical aspects.
Remember, asking for help is not a weakness. Part of managing your condition involves knowing
when and how to find help. Asking for help can be difficult, but most people want to be helpful
but may not know how.
Finding resources
This can be quite a detective job. Sometimes it can be quick to find the right information, but
other times it can take a while to find what you’re looking for. We hope to provide specific pointers
for more common issues in the pages that follow, but not everything can be anticipated. If you
need help that is not covered here, try asking yourself the following questions:

1. What is the issue?
2. What it is that you need or want that might address it?
3. Who/where might have leads to find this solution?

- Is there someone or a company on the internet or in the phone book? Your local council

might have a helpline or a directory of local services. You can find your local council
details on gov.uk/find-local-council.

- Can friends, family or neighbours advise? o Are you aware of any services or
  organisations that might deal with similar issues?
- Is there someone in your community or social network who is well connected, the sort
  of person who “knows everyone”? They might have ideas.
- Citizens Advice might be able to help about a whole range of things. You can get advice

by email or chat online. You can also call their national phone line or arrange to see an
advisor locally. For more details on how you can contact Citizens Advice and their opening
hours, visit citizensadvice.org.uk

- A ‘link worker’ service is being introduced in the NHS in 2020/21. If they exist in your area
  they will normally be a good source of local knowledge about support available. You can
  contact your GP to see if they are available in your area.
  Appointments & Hospital Stays
  Appointments
  Most people with Parkinson’s remain under the care of a
  specialist (usually a Neurologist or Geriatrician) for life. They
  usually see them every 6-12months. In addition, in many areas
  there are also Parkinson’s Nurse Specialists, working either in the
  community or in the hospital. Some of these specialist nurses
  hold outpatient appointments, and most do telephone calls. A
  few will see people in their own homes. You may also have
  appointments with other teams, either in relation to your Parkinson’s or for other health reasons.
  Appointments can be stressful, and stress tends to make Parkinson’s symptoms worse. The best
  way to reduce the stress and make the most out of your appointment is to plan ahead. Here are
  some things you may wish to consider beforehand:
  Do you want someone to come with you?
  This should be someone you trust. It might be for emotional support, to help you remember what
  is said by the professional you see, or to help describe your experiences to the professional if they
  know you well. It is up to you whether or not someone else comes in with you – if you want
  privacy they can wait outside.
  How will you get there?
  So that getting to the appointment is not a cause of stress you could check out the directions to
  the appointment in advance. You could also allow yourself plenty of time so that you are not
  pressured. If the appointment is at a hospital, they will often send out details of where to go. This
  is usually with the appointment letter. There should also be a telephone number to contact if you
  need more information.
  Hospital transport: Hospitals can provide transport to appointments in specific circumstances.
  This must be planned ahead. To book this they will need to know how much help you will need.
  There should be information about hospital transport in your appointment letter. If not call the
  number on your appointment letter as soon as possible.
  Do you need an interpreter?
  Hospitals and GP surgeries should have interpretation services available. This will need to be
  planned ahead. There may be information in your appointment letter. If not call the number on
  your appointment letter as soon as possible to request an interpreter.
  What do you want out of it?
  It is helpful to think about what you are expecting from the appointment. It is also helpful to think
  about any specific questions you wish to ask. Many people find it helpful to write them down.
