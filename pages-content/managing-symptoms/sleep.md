# Sleep Disturbances and Dreams in Parkinson’s

## Sleep Disturbances

1. **Parkinson’s-related causes**

   - Altered dopamine levels affect sleep patterns and movements.
   - Difficulty moving in bed due to stiffness or rigidity.
   - REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (acting out dreams).

2. **Other contributing factors**
   - Urinary symptoms (night-time urination).
   - Pain, cramps, or muscle spasms.
   - Anxiety or low mood.
   - Medications that affect sleep.
   - Obstructive Sleep Apnea (pauses or loud snoring during sleep).

## Practical Strategies to Improve Sleep

### 1. Maintain a consistent routine

- Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily, even on weekends.
- Include relaxing pre-bed activities (warm bath, gentle massage, breathing exercises).

### 2. Optimize daytime activity

- Exercise during the day, but avoid vigorous exercise 2 hours before bedtime.

### 3. Manage the bedroom environment

- Keep the room quiet, dark, and comfortably cool (16–18°C).
- Avoid using the bedroom for TV or work.
- Consider eye masks or earplugs if needed.

### 4. Bed and clothing tips

- Nylon or satin sheets and lightweight bed covers can make movement easier.
- Avoid both satin pajamas and satin sheets at the same time—they may slide too much.
- Maintain some friction areas at bed edges for grip.

### 5. Pre-bed habits

- Empty your bladder before sleeping.
- Limit caffeine (4 hours before bed) and alcohol.
- Avoid large meals right before sleep (allow 2–3 hours for digestion).
- Minimize screen time before bed (TV, phone, tablet).
- Avoid lying awake for long periods—get up if you can’t sleep.
- Limit daytime naps to ~20 minutes if needed.

## When to Seek Professional Help

- **Severe sleep disruption**: If violent movements, frequent waking, or distressing dreams occur.
- **Signs of sleep apnea**: Pauses in breathing, choking, gasping, loud snoring.
- **Persistent poor sleep**: After 1 month of self-management strategies.

## Professional Assessment

- **Questions your clinician may ask**:

  - Sleep patterns, triggers, and associated symptoms (pain, RLS, urinary issues).
  - Bed partner observations (snoring, breathing pauses, movements).
  - Medication timing and effects.
  - Daytime impact (mood, concentration, balance).

- **Tests**:
  - Usually not needed, but sometimes a sleep study may be recommended.

## Medication Options

- **May help**:

  - Optimized Parkinson’s meds (Levodopa, dopamine agonists).
  - Slow-release forms or patches for overnight coverage.
  - Melatonin, clonazepam (for REM Sleep Behavior Disorder).

- **May worsen sleep**:
  - Amantadine, Selegiline, high-dose Levodopa, some dopamine agonists.
  - Opiates, SSRIs, ephedrine.

## Tracking Symptoms

- Use a sleep diary to record:
  - Bedtime/wake time
  - Night-time awakenings
  - Medication timing
  - Other symptoms (pain, cramps, urinary needs)
  - Partner observations (if possible)

## Key Takeaways

- Parkinson’s affects sleep via dopamine changes, movement difficulties, and other symptoms.
- Lifestyle and environmental adjustments can help improve sleep.
- Medications may need optimization but never change them without professional guidance.
- Severe or persistent sleep problems should be discussed with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist.
