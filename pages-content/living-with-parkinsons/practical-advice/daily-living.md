Every day activities can become more difficult than they once were. Muscle weakness, tremor and issues with movement or balance can make it harder to do a daily activity that you could do before. Examples include eating and drinking, preparing meals, getting washed and dressed, brushing your teeth, or going to the toilet.

Being able to keep doing these activities is important to keep independent and active.

There are some tried and tested methods to do this. You could make changes to the way you do things, to your environment, or to the adaptive equipment you use. There are NHS, social care and voluntary sector professionals that can help you (see More Information at the bottom of this pag). Please also see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page for information about making adaptations to your home and guidance about different types of accommodation.

All the tips and strategies here are things you could try for yourself. If you keep having problems, there are certain professionals who can help you: occupational therapists and physiotherapists. They will first want to have an assessment with you. They can then share more strategies and advice on equipment that may help you (discussed further below). Ask your GP or Parkinson’s team about a referral.

### Bathing & showering

These can become more difficult, especially due to concerns over slipping and falling.

- Do not use radiators or toilet roll holders to push/lean on or taps or towel rail to pull up from to help you get up – these can come off the wall and cause a fall.
- If you do need something to hold on to, adaptations such as grab rails are discussed on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page.
- Shower heads on a hose rather than fixed in place can help you get the water exactly where it’s needed.

### Moving around the home

- Remove old items from around the home to increase space.
- Remove loose rugs to prevent trips and falls.
- You may find it helpful to rearrange furniture to increase the amount of space you have to move around and reduce risk of trips or falls.
- Use seating that is firm, has a straight back and has arms. These will be easier to get up from.
- Also see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/mobility" class="internal-link">_Mobility_</a> page for more advice on getting around.

### Grooming & dental care

Shaving, brushing your hair, applying make-up or brushing your teeth can all become more difficult due to reduced dexterity or grip or additional movements like tremor or dyskinesia.

- Sit at the sink. Sitting on a perching stool or chair can help provide some extra stability.
- Resting your elbows on the sink edge can increase stability.
- Consider an electric toothbrush – most have a wider handle, can be heavier and require less detailed movement. You can also try foam tubing to widen the toothbrush handle.
- Brushing teeth to music can help.
- Consider an electric shave rather than a razor blade.
- Consider a wide brush handle over a small comb for brushing hair.

Managing dental hygiene is important for the health of your teeth and gums. Poor dental hygiene can worsen symptoms, such as difficulties eating. See our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/lifestyle factors" class="internal-link">_Lifestyle Factors_</a> page for more on this.

### Dressing

Dressing may become more difficult due to stiffness, reduced dexterity or difficulties balancing.  
Reduced hand movements can affect fastenings, like buttons and zips.

- Allow yourself time to get dressed.
- Where possible sit to dress on the edge of the bed or chair.
- Try Velcro fastenings.
- Leave clothing items fastened where possible.
- Choose items with fewer buttons.
- Wear items that are slightly larger size, loose fitting or stretchy fabrics.
- Try a front fastening bra or bra top.
- Attach a fabric loop or pull to your zipper.
- Small aids such as a button hook may help.
- Elastic shoelaces can be easier.
- Try a long handled shoe horn to put shoes on.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/dressing.jpg" alt="dressing" class="daily-living__dressing">

### Using the toilet

Getting up and to the toilet and then getting up from the toilet again can be tricky if your movements are stiffer, slower or less well balanced. This is extra tricky if the toilet seat is lower than knee level.  
Reduced movements can also make it more difficult to clean yourself after using the toilet.

- Try to remove obstacles from your route to the toilet from your main living area.
- Some people find a ‘bottom wiper’, which is a long handle aid, helpful.
- Flushable moist toilet/wet wipes can help with this (although there are concerns these are not environmentally friendly, as can block narrow drainpipes and take a long time to disintegrate).

See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/urination" class="internal-link">_Urinary Symptoms_</a> and <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/bowels" class="internal-link">_Bowel Symptoms_</a> pages for more tips.

### Movements in & around bed

These may be tricky due to stiffness, reduced movements and balance problems.

- Satin sheets can help you turn over in bed
  - You can buy them either off-the-shelf satin sheets or specially designed sheets with satin panels (e.g. a panel of satin going across the middle of the bed where hips would rest)
  - If you use satin sheets or panels, make sure there is an area of friction at either end or sides of the bed so you can get a grip on something
- Satin pyjamas can also help you turn in bed.
  - Don’t wear satin pyjamas at the same time as satin sheets – this will increase the risk of sliding out of bed too quickly.
- Light weight bedding is preferable.

If the issue is about feeling weak or dizzy when getting out of bed, see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/dizziness" class="internal-link">_Dizziness_</a> symptom page for tips.

### Eating & drinking

There are a range of steps with regards to food and drink:

- Grocery shopping may be more difficult due to reduced mobility or balance.
  - Consider online deliveries
  - Consider what services are available locally
  - Consider teaming up with a friend or neighbour to do the shopping together
- Meal preparation may be hard due to reduced dexterity or grip, or tremor or dyskinesia. Difficulties in thinking can affect planning and can make cooking more difficult.
  - Cutlery with wider handles may be easier to use.
  - Special equipment has been developed for these difficulties – see below.
  - You may find it easier to follow a recipe step-by-step and tick off as you go through.
- Handling food and drink may be more difficult for the same reasons:
  - Cutlery with wider handles may be easier to use.
  - Consider the timing of your meals to avoid the times when your symptoms are worse.
  - Consider sports bottles, cups that have a narrow nozzle, or cups with lids (e.g. travel cups or ‘sip cups’) to reduce the risk of spillages.
  - Place foods or liquids in smaller containers to make them easier to grab and handle. For example, it’s easier to manage a pint of milk rather than a larger, heavier 4 pint milk carton.
  - Special equipment has been developed for these difficulties – see below.
- For difficulties in swallowing, please see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/swallowing" class="internal-link">_Swallowing Difficulties_</a> symptom page.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “Maybe there’s things for people like my mum, she likes to stay independent – like sometimes she’ll say ‘Do you know what, I want to cook today’, you know like electric tin cutters and things like that to help make your life a bit easier.”  
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

### Domestic tasks

Living with Parkinson’s can make daily activities and chores more difficult as the condition progresses. If this is affecting you, there are things you can do and support you can access to help you to maintain your independence.

- **Plan ahead**
  - On the night before, think about how you plan to spend the day. This can be domestic tasks, social activities, appointments, what to eat, etc. It may take you longer to complete the tasks than before your diagnosis. This is perfectly fine, so allow enough time to not rush.
- **Get rest between chores**
  - You might find some tasks are harder than others or take up more time and energy. It’s important to rest for 30 minutes between chores to prevent you from feeling fatigued. Make sure this is something you find relaxing that doesn’t involve physically or mentally pushing yourself. For example, reading a book, watching TV, or sleeping for 30 minutes.
- **Set achievable goals**
  - Setting unrealistic goals can put you under pressure to complete everything in that day. It is okay to finish the task when you feel less tired (whether that’s on the same day or another day). It is recommended to start with less demanding tasks and increase them throughout the day, if appropriate.
- **Consider your cleaning equipment**
  - Use cleaning equipment with long handles on mops, brushes, and dust pans. This will help you to avoid bending down or being in positions that may be hard to get back up from. An Occupational Therapist (OT) can make recommendations tailored to you.
- **Adapt your approach**
  - If energy or balance are significant concerns, try sitting down while doing tasks such as ironing, washing, and folding to reduce the risk of falls and amount of energy used.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “If I’m having people around for dinner, I’ve got to make sure I’ve got a quiet day either side and I’ve got to plan ahead. So I’ll lay the table a couple of days before and I’ll try and shop and do a lot of the preparation before I actually have people round.”

Occupational therapists may suggest a rehabilitation approach. They will work with you to learn how to do things with a different approach. However, they may still suggest equipment.

The world of equipment can be overwhelming, and costly. Some equipment may be paid for by the NHS or through your local Social Services, but some you will need to buy yourself.

_We strongly recommend you speak to an occupational therapist before buying equipment. They will assess your needs, talk about different strategies and recommend the equipment that is best for you. They can then guide you through how to get the equipment if this is needed._

### Equipment for Bathing & Showering

- **Bath & shower seats** can help you get in and out of the bath with less risk of falling and to avoid others doing heavy lifting if you need help. They reduce problems with balance encountered when standing in the shower.
- Some bath seats sit across the top of the bath, either as a seat or as a simple board, which can be removable or on a hinge – note if on a hinge, it can be more complex and can be lowered into the bath manually or electrically.
  - Seats for shower cubicles can be free standing (stool or chair) or flip-down seat mounted on the wall.
- There are many different types: Small, waterproof stools to large, electrically powered seats.
- The seat that is best for you will depend on your shower or bath unit and your own preferences.
- The next step up from these equipment suggestions are more significant changes to your bathroom. See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page for information about adaptations.

### My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “When I knew I was having a problem getting out of the bath, I worked it out myself that I would have to do something in the bathroom. And I spoke to Age UK to get their advice. And they suggested grab rails. Then came the problem of buying the grab rails and installing them.  
> And one of my neighbours volunteered to.”  
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

### Equipment for Toileting

- **Hand-held urinals** are available for both men and women. This can be helpful if you need to urinate urgently but can’t get up quickly enough to go.
- **Commodes** are moveable toilets without running water – like a chair with a container underneath. These can be useful if you need the toilet urgently or often, especially at night.
- **Discreet disposable pads** can go in underwear in case of leakage.
- Some men with urinary incontinence prefer to use a **sheath** that fits over the penis and collects urine in a bag that straps to the leg.
- **Raised toilet seats** can help you get up more easily from a seated position on the toilet.
  - Make sure it is large enough for you to sit on comfortably and avoid leakage.
  - Make sure it isn’t too high for other people in the house.
  - Ensure that it can be safely removed and replaced.
  - Ask for assistance if you’re not able to fix it securely on the toilet.
- **Grab rails** – various types of rails can be installed to help you get on and off the toilet. See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page for more details on home adaptations.

Also see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/urination" class="internal-link">_Urinary Symptoms_</a> and <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/bowels" class="internal-link">_Bowel Symptoms_</a> pages for more tips.

### Bed & Mattress Equipment

These make it easier to get in and out of bed or to reposition in bed. Note ‘grab rails’, fixed to the wall, are discussed within _adaptations_ on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page. The height of your bed affects how easy it is to push yourself off the bed or to sit down. The ideal height of the bed surface depends on how tall you are, but many people find raising the bed or mattress helps.

- **Bed raisers** raise the whole bed a few inches:
  - Come in various heights – usually between 3–6 inches
  - Come in various materials to match the existing bed legs – wood, plastic, or metal
  - Make sure the bed raisers are stable and well supported
  - The legs of the bed must sit deep within the bed raisers, not rest on top of the raisers, or they might slip off
  - You must be able to touch the floor with your feet
- **Mattress Variators or Pillow Lifters** help lift you up into a seated position. They are more effective for fairly thin mattresses as thicker mattresses are difficult to bend and can scrunch up in the middle (less helpful and less comfortable). Mattress raisers come in different types:

  - Mechanical – can be set to a certain degree of elevation, but are more difficult to reposition
  - Electric – allow you to raise and lower the bed using a handheld control
  - Pneumatic – use air to inflate a pillow-like device under the mattress to raise and lower it. They can be set to inflate only on one side, turning you at the same time.
  - Choosing and using a mattress raiser:
    - Check that the controls are easy to use – single button controls might be simplest
    - Check how noisy the device is
    - Make sure electric cords, feeding lines or bedding won’t get caught up when the raiser is in motion
    - Be aware that in the raised position, a mattress raiser can cause you to slide down and out of the bed

- **Bed levers** or **bed rails** fix to the bed and have a metal handle that extends up the side of the mattress.

  - You shouldn't use a bed lever with an air mattress
  - They do require moderate upper body strength to use, and it is best to be trained by a professional to use them

- **Caution** using a bed lever with an adjustable bed or mattress raiser – special consideration is required to ensure it is secure. It is best to get professional advice for this.

### Beds

- Electric profiling or hospital beds allow you to control your position within the bed: usually allowing you to control an up & down movement of both the head end of the bed and a bend at the knees
- They can be used to help you sit up from lying down and can help you manage symptoms of dizziness or ankle swelling
- **Hospital beds** are usually height-adjustable and may have side rails. They may have casters or wheels, which allow the bed to be moved. These can be provided by a health professional such as your district nurse if needed
- **Electric profiling beds** tend to look more like an ordinary bed. Some double bed styles are available that split the mattress so each person can adjust the mattress to the position they want. They can raise up and down and some can raise your upper body and provide a knee break (see image).
- Comfort and safety tips:
  - Make sure electric cords, feeding lines or bedding won’t be caught up when the mattress is being raised
  - Take extra care if the bed has heavy sides that go up and down, as it may be easy for your fingers or hands to get caught (especially if the rail comes down suddenly)
  - Make sure the controls can be reached easily when lying down

### Hoists

- These equipment lift a person between a bed and a (wheel) chair, or a bed and a commode, and back
- There are several types available, e.g.:
  - Mobile
  - Ceiling fixed
  - Full body
  - Standing hoist
- You will need the correct one for you and your home as well as training to use it. It is not recommended that you buy a hoist on your own; you should first talk with an occupational therapist
- It is much harder to get out of furniture that is low and soft
- Special raisers for chairs can make it easier to stand up from
- A ‘lift cushion’ is a portable cushion that can be used on most chairs and sofas
- Electric lift chairs can be helpful if you have difficulty getting out of a chair as they provide support when going from sitting to standing

### Cutlery

- Several specialty designs are available:
  - All-in-one knife and fork
  - All-in-one fork and spoon
  - Special handles that are extra-large, easy-grip, extra-light (moulded rubber), weighted or curved
  - Foam sleeves, which can be placed over existing cutlery to make them easier to hold
  - Cutlery which can be bent to suit different grips
- If your movements are slow and stiff, extra-large or curved-handled cutlery may work best for you
- If you have a tremor, a combined fork and spoon, a heavier item, or a utensil with moulded rubber handles may work best for you
- Special food preparation knives are available:
  - Curved-handled or rocking action knife can be used for chopping food
  - The handle is D or L-shaped to give you more control and usually made of easy-grip material
  - They come in a variety of sizes
- These are often available in high street mobility shops or online. See our advice about buying equipment before you make a purchase.

### Equipment for Plates & Bowls

- **Plate guards** clip onto the plate and provide an upright ring around it.
  - It stops food from falling off the edge of your plate, and can be used to push the food back onto your fork or spoon by pressing the utensil and food against it.
  - They come in various sizes, colours and materials. Some people prefer styles made of sturdy materials that are easier to wash.
  - Note: some are positioned about an inch in from the outer edge of the plate, which can decrease the usable area of the plate.
- **Non-slip food mats** are made of a special tacky silicone or plastic material, which you put under a plate or bowl to stop it from moving around while you eat.
  - They can be especially helpful if you have limited mobility in one arm and find yourself chasing your plate across the table.
  - They can also be used on trays to stop cups from sliding; or between a mixing bowl and work surface to stop the bowl from moving around.
  - Come in a range of colours – you can buy them pre-cut as a placemat, or you can buy the material and cut to the size you need.

### Cups

As well as usual off-the-shelf lidded cups, there are other specialised designs that can make drinking easier.

- Nosey cups have a section cut out on one side, opposite the position of the mouth when drinking. The cut-out allows the person drinking to tilt and drain the cup more easily with limited neck movement.
- All of these cups come in different sizes, shapes, and colours and may have handles – consider what you will use it for, so that it is fit-for-purpose (e.g. an appropriate material for hot drinks).

### Hot Water Devices

- ‘Kettle tippers’ are designed to cradle your kettle. This allows you to pour boiling water out of the kettle without lifting it up.
  - They can reduce risk of spills and burns.
  - They can be used on different common teapot or kettle styles.
  - Check it works with your kettle before buying.
- Boiling water dispensers provide boiling water without a kettle or saucepan.
  - You fill them manually, with a certain amount, then they dispense a specified amount of boiling water.
  - Fairly easy to use.
  - They enable only the amount of water needed to be boiled.

### Home Access

- **Key turner**: A key turner is a handle that attaches to your keys and provides easier grip and leverage for turning keys.
- **Key safe**: This is a small secure box, fitted to a wall outside the front door to hold the keys to your home. It requires a code to access: you choose whom to give the code to. This can be very useful as multiple sets of keys do not need to be provided to family members or healthcare professionals. It will also allow people to access the house in case of an emergency.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/rail-from-housing.jpg" alt="grab-rails" class="daily-living__rail-from-housing">

### Alarms and Security

- There is a wide range of systems available to either attract attention or contact someone in case of emergency.
- Basic alarms: can be worn (e.g. on your wrist or as a pendant) or placed in the home. When you press the alarm, they can either make a loud noise or send a signal to someone.
- Security systems, for example:
  - Devices to track your location so someone could find you if needed.
  - Sensors that detect if you fall over.
- More information about these systems is available on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Website</a> and the <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/later-life-care" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which?

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:

> “We have a flat mat that you put on the floor. An alarm goes off. If you put it on the floor by the side of the bed, and as soon as you step on it, an alarm goes off. Very loudly.”

Standard equipment and smaller adaptations (for example, an additional stair rail or raised toilet seat) recommended by an occupational therapist are often provided free of charge. Some equipment does come with a charge. An Occupational Therapist can assess your needs and advise further.

However, if you are buying your own equipment, here are a few tips:

1. Be informed: The Disabled Living Foundation has a range of fact sheets offering a range of general advice regarding features to look for when considering equipment.
2. Consider _how_ and _where_ you will use the equipment and the impact on others who use the space.
3. Try the equipment before you buy it:
   - To find your nearest equipment demonstration centre, check the <a href="https://www.livingmadeeasy.org.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disabled Living Foundation’s website</a>. You can search “equipment centre” for a list of equipment centres.
   - If possible, try out the different types to see which kind you find helpful.
   - The same website offers guidance on suppliers and allows you to compare products. You can search “askSARA” on their website for more information.
4. Make sure the _fit_ of the equipment is correct.
5. Local pharmacies and disability shops sell equipment. Short term hire can be possible from local organisations, such as the Red Cross Society.

If daily tasks are particularly challenging, some people need assistance from a person. The degree of assistance will vary, and as much independence as possible should still be encouraged. There are two main categories to consider discussed here:

- 'Home help'
- 'Home care'

There is also information on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/for-family-and-carers" class="internal-link">_Guidance for Family & Carers_</a> page for people who are supporting someone they know.

---

## Home Help

‘Home Help’ refers to support for domestic tasks such as laundry, washing up and cleaning. Local councils do not usually provide this. Many charities offer these services, though there may be a charge.

For example:

- Royal Voluntary Service
- The British Red Cross
- Age UK

Details for all of these and for more information about Home Help can be found at the end of this section in the _More Information_ section.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/home-care.jpg" alt="home-care" class="daily-living__home-care">

---

## Home Care

‘Home Care’ refers to support for personal tasks such as showering, dressing and preparing meals. If you think you might benefit from paid Home Care:

1. The first step is to get a Needs Assessment.
   - Contact your Local Council Adult Social Care Department for this. They will make an assessment to see if Home Care is recommended.
   - If it is not recommended but you want it, you could arrange it privately. The Adult Social Care Department should still support you with this, for example giving information about local providers.
2. If Home Care is recommended, then they will complete a financial assessment. This determines whether or not the council will financially contribute to your Home Care costs.
   - The <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/appointments-and-hospital-stays" class="internal-link">_Finances_</a> page has more information about benefits you may be eligible for to help with costs.
3. You then need to arrange the Home Care.
   - If the council are paying, they can arrange the Home Care for you.
   - If the council are paying, you can still choose to arrange the Home Care yourself. For this ask to receive your ‘personal budget’ as a direct payment.
   - If the council will not contribute financially, you will need to find and pay for it yourself.
   - The council should be able to support you with finding care, whichever category you are in.

**There are broadly two options for finding Home Care:**

**a. Go through a Home Care Agency**
Agencies arrange for trained carers to visit you in your home, but it may not always be the same carer. The agency holds responsibility as the employer of the carer. They are registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).

_Or_

**b. Directly employ a Home Care Worker yourself**
This way you know who you are getting, but you have legal responsibility as an employer and need to plan for the carer’s holiday and sickness. Note this responsibility is yours if you directly employ the carer, even if you receive financial support from the council. Individual carers do not have to be registered with a regulatory body.

### Finding a Home Care Agency

1. First find out what is available in your area. Suggested resources:
   - NHS website
   - Your local council
   - United Kingdom Homecare Association (UKHCA)
   - Which? Later Life Care – online Care Services Directory
   - Is there anyone in your area who you trust who has experience? Can they make a recommendation?
2. Get more information about them:
   - Agencies are registered and reviewed by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) so consider reading the report.
   - Could you ask someone with experience of that agency for an informal review?
   - Contact the provider to ask more about their service.

### Directly Employing a Home Care Worker

1. Find out what is available in your area. Suggested resources:
   - NHS website
   - Your local council
   - Search online
   - Is there anyone in your area who you trust who has experience? Can they make a recommendation?
   - You could use a Broker or Introductory Care Agency. These help you find the Home Care Worker, but you still directly employ them. Note these agencies are not registered with the CQC.
2. Approach them and get more information about them:
   - Write a job description to be clear what is required.
   - Ask for references.
   - Meet them in person.
   - Write a contract and get it checked.
   - Ensure you follow all of the requirements of an employer (see <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">_Legal Matters_</a>).
   - For more guidance see the <a href="https://www.which.co.uk/later-life-care" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Which? Later Life Care website</a>.

## For both 'Home help' & 'Home care' – things to Ask About:

- **Cost**: What is the cost? What services incur an extra cost? Does the time of the shift affect the cost (e.g. evenings, weekends, bank holidays)?
- **Experience**: Do the care workers have experience in supporting someone with similar needs to you? _For an agency:_ How do they allocate the care workers to ensure suitable?
- **Training**: What training have the care workers had?
- **Timing**: Will the care worker visit at a specified time? What is the procedure if they are running late?
- **Contract**: Can you review a standard contract?
- **Contact**: How can the agency or Care Worker be contacted, including for emergencies outside office hours?
- _For directly employing an individual:_
  - How would you pay them – method and how often?
  - What happens if they are ill or unable to attend for any other reason?
  - Could anyone cover for their holiday?

---

## Where Can I Get Help?

- **National Health Service (NHS)** – outpatient and community therapy teams, including Occupational Therapists. Referral pathways vary by area. In most places your GP will be able to refer to occupational therapy.
- **Adult Social Care** – Some occupational therapists work within Adult Social Care services. Other social care professionals, such as social workers, can also help you with advice and equipment. You can find contact details for your social services on your council website or can ask at your GP.
- **Voluntary sector** – Charities and third sector organisations may be able to help. They can offer some support, and some have short-term equipment hire services.
- **Private sector** – Local pharmacies and disability shops are common on the high street. You can also find a wide range of providers online.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:

> “As an OT, we might assess somebody shopping, cooking, cleaning, to see how they manage washing, transfers in and out of the bath, up and down steps. To see where the difficulty lies and what we could then try to do to lessen that difficulty. And also, we encourage graded activity, somebody who isn’t doing much to gradually get back into doing more.”
> _(Occupational Therapist)_
