# Work and Caring

A diagnosis of Parkinson’s does not mean you have to leave your job or not work again. Many people with Parkinson’s can still work. The important thing to consider is how the symptoms of Parkinson’s may impact your work and day-to-day life.

---

## Working with Parkinson’s

Depending on the type of work you do, different Parkinson’s symptoms may cause you challenges.

For example:

- Getting around the workplace may be difficult due to mobility or tiredness.
- Sitting for long periods may cause you to feel dizzy when standing.
- Physical tasks may be hard to complete due to fatigue or motor symptoms.
- Public speaking may be challenging due to changes in speech, movements or confidence.
- Writing or using technology may be harder due to motor symptoms.
- Working long hours can increase fatigue and cause symptoms to vary.

This should not stop you from working if you wish to continue. You may need to adapt your job slightly or find ways to manage these work-related issues. For more advice, see our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/movement" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> and <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/reading-writing-and-technology" class="internal-link">_Reading, Writing & Technology_</a> pages.

You can speak to your GP or specialist about ways to help you better manage your symptoms for the type of work you do.

### Do I need to tell my employer?

It can be tough deciding whether to tell your employer about your condition. For the most part, it is your decision whether you inform your employer. But there are certain situations where you should tell your employer:

- If your disability can cause a health and safety risk to yourself or others. For example, if you are a driver.
- When you need to make adaptations or changes to your work. This might be, for example, reducing the number of hours you work.

Other reasons may impact on your decision to tell you employer, such as:

- You may feel your symptoms are not noticeable and are not yet impacting your work.
- You do not feel comfortable telling your employer.
- You feel you will be treated differently.
- You prefer to be open about your condition and reassure your employer you are still capable of doing the job.

**How should I tell my employer?**
It may help to talk to other people who have a diagnosis of Parkinson’s. They could tell you about their experiences of what worked for them and what might be helpful for you. If you don’t know anyone in your situation, you might find it helpful to contact one of the Parkinson’s UK groups for Working Age people or to visit the Parkinson’s UK Forum. Details of the groups and the forum are on the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> website.

It is worth taking the time to think about some key points that you want to tell your employer. For example, this may include:

- A brief explanation of what Parkinson’s is
- How you are feeling now
- How symptoms might affect your work now or in the future
- Adaptations or changes that would be helpful for you in your job

In some cases, having a friend or union rep with you might be a source of support at such conversations.

### Do I need to tell colleagues?

You are under no legal obligation to tell your colleagues and so the decision is completely up to you.
If you do not feel comfortable with your colleagues knowing, then you do not have to tell them.

The reasons for deciding whether to tell your colleagues may be similar to deciding if you tell your employer. You may decide to tell them if you feel that your condition may impact their work or health and safety.

**How should I tell my colleagues?**
If you decide you would like to tell your colleagues, there are several ways you could do this:

- Decide with your manager whether it is better for yourself or your manager to talk with the team.
- Decide what information you would like to share with them.
- Organise for an expert (e.g. Parkinson’s nurse, Parkinson’s UK representative) from the local area to visit your work. They may be able to give information to the team and answer any questions.
- Remember, there is no pressure to tell your colleagues if you do not feel comfortable to do so.

## Adjustments at Work

Under the Equality Act 2010, employers have to make reasonable adjustments for someone with a long-term condition (including Parkinson’s). There are different adjustments that could be made but there are no clear definitions within the Equality Act that outline how much can be adjusted. To work out what adjustments might help you, speak with an ‘occupational health advisor’ or ‘access to work assessor’. You can do this by asking your manager or Human Resources (HR) to put you in touch with one. See below for some examples of adjustments you may wish to discuss.

### Hours

Working a lot of hours every week may be challenging for you. If it becomes too stressful then it could worsen symptoms. Think about what you feel you can realistically manage and discuss this with your manager. This may involve doing 4 days a week instead of 5 days, or going down to part-time hours. You may feel that your symptoms are not impacting your work yet and you can still work your normal hours. Either way, set out clear expectations and outline that this could change over time as the condition progresses.

### Duties

Depending on the type of job you have and your symptoms, there may be duties that need to be delegated to other colleagues. This may also involve taking on new duties that are manageable for you. For example, as a teacher you may decide to reduce the number of your teaching hours due to speech difficulties. Instead, you may be able to do more administrative work. So, it can help to talk with your manager about what duties you can still do and if your role may need to change.


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/work.jpg" alt="working" class="example-class">

### Support

Make it clear to your employer what support you would like if, for example, you are having a day where your symptoms are particularly bothersome. For example, you may want counselling support through work or to work from home a few days each week.

### Flexibility

</div>


It is important for your employer to understand that Parkinson’s is a progressive condition. It is also worth making them aware that the severity of your symptoms can change quickly within the same day. Ideally, there needs to be a level of flexibility. For example, some weeks you may work less than your agreed hours but other weeks more.

Once you and your employer have agreed on some workplace adjustments, it is best to get this in writing and signed by both parties. This is known as a workplace adjustment agreement.

If you are a member of your trade union at work, you can ask them for support. For example, if you didn’t feel comfortable speaking to your employer alone you can ask a trade union representative to attend meetings with you. They can also help you learn more about your legal rights.

## Time Off Work

UK law entitles employees to take time off work if they are ill. If you are off work for less than 7 days in a row (includes weekends and bank holidays) then you do not need to provide any proof of sickness from a healthcare professional. If have more than 7 days off in a row due to sickness, then you will need a ‘fit note’ (sometimes called a ‘sick note’) for further days.

If you are off work for more than 4 working days in a row, you be able to apply for Statutory Sick Pay. Statutory sick pay means your employer will pay you if you are ill and cannot go to work for up to 28 weeks. It is worth discussing sick pay schemes with your HR department or checking your contract of employment. Some employers may offer more sick pay than the legal requirement.

Some people may find this difficult if they are on zero hours contracts or are self-employed. If so, seek advice from Citizen’s Advice.

### Self-certification

If you are off work for 7 days or less, when you return to work your employer can ask you to confirm you have been off sick. This is called ‘self-certification’. You should agree with your employer how this should be done – it sometimes involves filling in a form or sending details by email.

### Fit Notes

<div class="video-container">

</iframe>
</div>

You can get a fit note from a GP or hospital doctor. This service is free of charge if requested after the 7 days. If your employer agrees, a similar document can be provided by a physiotherapist, podiatrist or occupational therapist instead. This is called an Allied Health Professional (AHP) Health and Work Report. The fit note will say whether you are ‘not fit for work’ or ‘may be fit for work’. If it says ‘may be fit for work’, you need to discuss with your employer whether there are adjustments that could be made to help you return to work (for example, different hours or tasks). You should keep the original note and offer your employer to take a copy, if required.


### Annual Leave

If you do not qualify for statutory sick pay but you still need paid time off work, the other option could be to use some of your annual leave or holiday.

## Voluntary Work

<div class="video-container">

</iframe>
</div>

For some people, voluntary work offers a great balance between working and being retired. You can have a sense of responsibility and achieve a sense of purpose without the stress of a full-time paid job. Some voluntary work can also be very flexible. So, on days or weeks where you are feeling good you can do more hours and on weeks that are worse you can do less hours. This is something you can decide with the scheme or activity co-ordinator.


The added benefit of volunteering is that it can boost your confidence and day-to-day wellbeing.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/volunteer.jpg" alt="volunteering" class="example-class">


### Deciding Where to Volunteer

There are many groups that look for volunteers. It is best to think about what you are passionate about and what experience you can bring. Some examples of places to volunteer are:

- **Parkinson’s charities:** This may give you the chance to share your knowledge and experience of living with Parkinson’s.
- **Charity shop:** Volunteering in a charity shop can provide opportunities to socialise by working behind the till or other activities.
- **Working with animals:** For example, you may wish to volunteer at kennels or help with dog walking in your local area.
- **Hospitals and care homes:** This may involve spending time with patients/residents or taking on more of an administrative role.
- **Helping to run local interest groups:** You can do this through educational, political, church, environmental, or social organisations. For example, you can visit the U3A website or search online ‘Friends of’ your local park or theatre. You can find the link in our More Information section below.

### Adjustments for Volunteering

The guidance for this is similar to that described above (see section ‘adjustments at work’). Take the time to discuss with the organisation any adjustments you may need to do the role. This might include flexible hours, change in duties (depending on your symptoms), and periods of time when you cannot come in. Have these discussions and get it in writing for you both to sign so that everyone’s expectations of your role are clear.

### Rights

As a volunteer, you do not have a contract of employment. This means you do not have the same rights as an employee. But you should have some sort of agreement that outlines what support you’ll get, the level of supervision, and the hours and duties that are expected of you.

## Caring for Others and Being Cared For

### Talking to Children

If you are diagnosed with Parkinson’s, it can be hard to decide how best to tell your children or grandchildren. You may be worried about how to start the conversation or how it might impact your family’s day-to-day life. You may also be debating whether you should tell your children in order to protect them. But it can help to be open and honest about your condition as children are aware of changes that happen at home. It will also
be increasingly difficult to hide the symptoms as they progress.

So, when you feel ready, try to be clear and specific in describing your symptoms. For example, discussing that your children may see you tremor or have difficulty walking at times. It is also important to remind them that even though you may not be able to do everything you could do before with them, you still love them.

If your children would like to talk to someone about how to deal with the news of a parent having Parkinson’s, or want more information, they can visit the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> website. Or, they can contact your local Parkinson’s UK support service (see the bottom of this page for contact details).

### Carers

You may provide care for someone, or you may find in time one of your friends or family becomes a carer for you. There is support available for carers and a good place to start is <a href="https://www.carersuk.org/home" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carer's UK</a> or the <a href="https://carers.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carer's Trust</a>. They have websites with useful information and contact details for local groups in your area. There is also information on our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page on tips and equipment people with Parkinson’s can try to help them remain as independent as possible in everyday tasks.

It is important carers look after themselves, so they can look after others. One way of doing this is by making sure they take regular breaks (sometimes called ‘respite’ or short-break care). Respite can involve a range of things, including: having support workers in your home; taking a holiday; or the person being cared for having a short stay in a care home. Also, your family or friends may be able to help you take a break by stepping in. Information about arranging respite care is available from your local council, who can arrange a carer’s assessment. Your local Carers service may be able to help too. If you have sufficient money you can pay for carer support or respite care. For information on what benefits carers may be entitled to visit our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/appointments-and-hospital-stays" class="internal-link">_Finances_</a> page.

For various reasons, some people can no longer be looked after at home and need to move to a care home. But this does not mean they are no longer helped by their family and friends. Many carers spend time visiting the care home and some help with care tasks. Many also continue to be involved in decisions about the person’s care. For more information on different options for supported living see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/housing" class="internal-link">_Housing_</a> page.
