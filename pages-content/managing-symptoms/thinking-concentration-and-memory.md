# Thinking and Remembering
Difficulties with thinking and remembering are common in Parkinson’s. They can be very worrying for the person experiencing these as well as for those around them. As we get older, we are likely to notice more difficulties with our memory, speed of thinking, and ability to do several things at once. But bigger changes, particularly if they affect day-to-day activities, are not normal and should be discussed with a healthcare professional. Vocabulary and reading do not normally get worse with age. Difficulties with thinking and memory are not always signs of dementia.

## What Might Be Causing It?
Memory and thinking problems can be symptoms of Parkinson’s, but not all of them are. The difficulties in Parkinson’s tend to come on slowly.

<ins>**Parkinson’s**</ins>tends to affect the following components of thinking: 
- _**Executive function:**_ This is the control of thinking, and includes planning, keeping things in mind, flexible thinking, and self-control. For example, when cooking a meal, someone with executive function problems may find it difficult to get all the right ingredients and plan what time to start cooking them so they will be ready at the same time.
- _**Attention:**_ (staying focused on something) This might be conscious or an automatic process such as listening in a conversation. Problems might, for example, show as difficulties reading, following a conversation, or multi-tasking.
- _**Language:**_ (remembering and understanding words and meanings) Problems might, for example, show as forgetting the word for something or not managing to understand more complex conversations.
- _**Visuospatial function:**_ This includes being able to judge distances and depth, imagine things visually and process them in your mind and detecting patterns. Problems might, for example, show as getting off at the wrong bus stop, misjudging the depth of a step or not being able to imagine the kitchen to describe where the tea is kept.
- _**Memory:**_ (being able to recall things) Problems might, for example, show as someone repeating themselves or not remembering the plot of a TV programme they recently watched. 

<ins>**Dementia**</ins> is a broad term used to describe gradual impairments of thinking, memory and other brain functions that are impacting day-to-day life. Dementia has lots of different types and causes, one of which is Parkinson’s. But not all thinking and memory problems in Parkinson’s are, or lead to, dementia. 

Other causes of memory and thinking problems that appear gradually include: 
- Depression and anxiety
- Sleep disturbance
- Various medications
- Hormone imbalances (e.g. hypothyroidism)
- Vitamin deficiencies (e.g. vitamin B12 deficiency)
- Alcohol abuse
- Abnormal blood chemistry (e.g. high calcium or low sodium levels). These are important to identify as they have specific treatments. 

Memory and thinking problems, or confusion, can also occur as sudden changes in alertness. This is known as <ins>**delirium**</ins>. The change in alertness may mean you feel hyperactive or drowsy, or you may fluctuate between these. There is no single test that can be done to diagnose delirium, so the diagnosis is made through assessment by a healthcare professional. Delirium is a response to a new stress put on the body. Tests may be done to identify the trigger which may then be treatable, though in many cases the cause is not found. Typical causes include: 
- Infections and other medical problems
- Medications
- Abnormal blood chemistry (e.g. high or low blood sugar levels).

## What Should I Do About It?
If there has been a sudden noticeable change in your thinking or memory (i.e. you become confused over hours or days) then you should see a healthcare professional urgently. If you are otherwise well this should be your GP, but if you are very ill then you should go to A&E. 
 
If the onset of your symptoms has been more gradual (weeks to months) then there is more time to act. If the symptoms persist more than 1 month or are impacting your daily life, then you should make a non-urgent appointment with your GP. You should also discuss them with your Parkinson’s specialist team. But there are many things you can try for yourself to deal with the symptoms as well.

### Take Your Time
Stress worsens thinking abilities so don’t put too much pressure on yourself. Tasks may take longer, so give yourself more time for them.

### Keep Well
Good sleep, physical health and emotional well-being are all important for your memory and thinking. 

See our _Optimising Wellbeing_ pages within the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/living-with-parkinsons" class="internal-link">Living with Parkinson's</a> section for more information. 

### Prompts and Reminders

- **Lists**: To-do lists, reminders for items to take out, etc.
- **Calendars/organisers**: Track appointments and birthdays.
- **Clocks and alarms**: Prominent clocks or alarms to remind you about medication or tasks.
- **Track events**: Record activities or symptoms using tools like the **Symptom & Activity Tracker**.

### Establish Routines

- Routines reduce cognitive load and make tasks more automatic.

### Social Support

- Engage friends or family to help with memory and attend appointments.
- Maintain social and leisure activities to support cognitive function.
- Consider **befriending services** through Parkinson’s UK or Age UK for regular contact with volunteers.

## Medication

You may find managing your Parkinson’s medication more challenging if you have problems with thinking or remembering. There are several devices available to help you; see the Medications page for more information.

## Slowing down the problem

There is no recommended treatment to stop or prevent memory and thinking problems. Things that may have some positive effects without harmful consequences include:

- Physical exercise – see our Keeping Active page for ideas.
- “Brain Training” or “Cognitive Training” – memory and attention puzzles and calculations (e.g. Sudoku).

It’s important to note there is not currently enough evidence to recommend these.

## Further Assessment

### Questions

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.
- See extra information below about what they might ask about with regard to memory and thinking.
  - Have you developed any new physical symptoms?
  - How has your mood been?
  - How has your sleep been?
  - Have you lost weight?
  - Have there been any recent changes to your medications?
  - How do the thinking and memory problems affect your day-to-day life? For example, working, taking medications, getting washed and dressed, paying your bills.
  - Have there been any serious consequences of the thinking and memory problems? For example, getting lost, getting into debt, driving accidents or near-misses, or leaving the gas on.

They may ask questions to assess different aspects of memory and thinking. Try not to worry about this too much as getting stressed can make it harder.

**Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker in your manual**

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- If you think the problem is variable, try recording when it is at its best and when it is at its worst. Note what you have done on those days that is different compared to a typical day.

### Tests

Depending on their assessment, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist may arrange some further tests.  
This may include blood tests, urine tests or occasionally a brain scan.

## Further Treatments

A healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance or possibly further treatment.

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.

**Some medication used for memory and thinking difficulties:**

- If a significant memory and thinking problem is identified, the first line treatment is a type of medication called a cholinesterase inhibitor. There are several different types, but most commonly used are rivastigmine or donepezil.
- If these are not suitable due to other medical problems, or if the side effects are a big problem, then the next choice is a medication called memantine.

**Some medications that may make memory and thinking worse for some people:**

- Anticholinergic medications (e.g. oxybutynin, solifenacin, amitriptyline)
- Parkinson’s medications (e.g. selegiline or amantadine)
- Sedating medications (e.g. benzodiazepines like diazepam and clonazepam).

### Referral

- You may be referred on to another service. Please be aware that there is usually a waiting time before the next service will see you.
- The typical referral for memory and thinking problems is to a multi-professional service called a “memory clinic”. Or, you may be referred for a specialist assessment by a cognitive neuropsychologist.

## Key Messages

- Thinking and memory problems are not always a sign of dementia.
- Looking after your physical and emotional wellbeing may help with your memory and thinking.
