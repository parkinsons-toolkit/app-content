# Impulsive Behaviours

‘Impulsive’ and ‘compulsive’ behaviours occur when someone has difficulty controlling urges or desires.  
This means they behave in a way that is out of character or undertake activities that they would not normally do.  
The individual may not even be aware of the problem.  

People with impulsive and compulsive behaviours are driven to things that give instant reward.  
Examples include:  
- Sexual behaviours  
- Gambling  
- Binge eating  
- Obsessive shopping  

Other examples:  
- Spending excessive time on a hobby or DIY, interfering with daily life  
- Taking objects apart  
- Continuously holding or handling objects  

> The ‘reward’ might not be what you expect — e.g. the act of gambling, not winning, or the act of shopping, not the purchased product.

## Why does this happen?

- The behaviour/activity brings feelings of pleasure  
- Stopping brings feelings of tension  
- Restarting relieves that tension  

This cycle can lead to impulsive behaviours similar to addiction.  
Sometimes people continue even after the original feeling of pleasure is gone.

### Dopamine dysregulation syndrome
Some people may compulsively take more Parkinson’s medication than prescribed.  
- They may be addicted to the way it makes them feel  
- Reducing medication can cause upset feelings, cravings, or reduced mobility  
- Some may become aggressive or hoard medication  

Others may not realise they are overusing medication — this is why it’s important that family or carers know the prescribed dose.

## What might be causing it?

- Dopamine plays a key role in reward and motivation  
- Parkinson’s medications affect dopamine signalling and therefore this control  

More likely if:  
- Taking **dopamine agonists** (ropinirole, rotigotine, pramipexole, bromocriptine)  
- Taking **levodopa** (less commonly, but still possible)  
- Younger at diagnosis  
- Family history of alcoholism or addictive behaviours  
- Male (appears more common than in females)  

These behaviours can develop **at any stage**, even after long-term use of medication.

## What should I do about it?

- People with Parkinson’s, loved ones, and carers should be aware of the risk  
- Report any unusual or impulsive behaviours to a specialist as soon as noticed  
- The best treatment is careful medication adjustment or changes  

### Speak to your specialist
- Most effective management: speak to your specialist for medication changes or dose adjustments  
- Talk to your GP or specialist as soon as concerning changes are spotted  

### Monitor for potential problems
- People may not recognise the problem themselves  
- Let trusted others know about the risk so they can watch for signs  
- Warning signs:  
  - Weight gain from binge eating  
  - Increased spending/borrowing money  
  - Increased sexual behaviours  
  - Other unusual changes  
- Some find it helpful to share bank statements with a trusted person  

### Reducing risk
- Block websites (pornography, gambling, shopping)  
- Give cards to a trusted person for safekeeping or limit spending access  
- Only keep the medications needed for each day — prevents overuse  

### Look after your mental wellbeing
- Stress, anxiety, and depression can worsen impulsive/compulsive behaviours  
- See *Optimising Wellbeing* pages for tips

## Further Treatments

- Treating depression can reduce compulsive behaviours  
- Psychological/talking therapies may help  

### Medication
- Specialists can adjust/change Parkinson’s or other medications to reduce behaviours  
- Referral to psychologist or psychiatrist may be offered  
- **Never change your medications without professional advice**

## Key Messages

- Impulsive and compulsive behaviours can cause someone to act out of character  
- Affected individuals may not realise the impact  
- These can be difficult to talk about, but they are recognised side effects of medication  
- Best management: **early reporting** and **specialist-led medication adjustments**
