# Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments

## Apomorphine injections

### What is it?

Intermittent injections of a medicine called apomorphine (a dopamine agonist). The injections go into the skin, a bit like an epi-pen or insulin pen. The medication works quickly, in 5-10 minutes. It lasts for about 40 minutes.

You may be able to have this treatment if:

- You are diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have specific difficulties, such as:
  - Significant periods where the medication has become less effective, ‘off’ periods.
- Your symptoms respond well to medication.
  - Symptoms that don’t get better with other Parkinson’s medications don’t tend to improve with apomorphine injections either. These may include problems with speaking, swallowing, falling due to loss of postural reflexes, or ‘freezing’ when the medication is otherwise working well (‘on’ periods). These may also include other non-motor symptoms such as apathy, drooling of saliva, constipation, or sleep disturbances, etc.
- You have sudden and unpredictable changes in your symptoms.
- “Off” periods that aren’t controlled by other Parkinson’s medications. This might include severe movement difficulties first thing in the morning before the tablet medication kicks in.
- You do not need more than a certain number of injections per day. If more are needed, a pump may be considered (see below).
- People (or their carers) are able to give themselves injections (after being trained). If people with Parkinson’s or carers are not able to give injections, an apomorphine pump may be considered.
- A pump may be able to be supported by a district nurse or another nurse.


### What should I expect from the assessment process?

Apomorphine injections are a specialised treatment that is only managed by specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital.

If your Parkinson’s specialist team think it might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a specialist centre. They will usually have a trial of the medication to see if it helps. This is often done in a planned day visit to hospital. You may be asked to take an anti-nausea tablet for three days before the trial. The Parkinson’s nurse or doctor will measure how much medication is needed to improve motor symptoms in order to select a starting dose.

### What does the procedure involve?

You will learn and practice how to use the medication. The specialist centre will assess that you or a carer are able to use the injectable pens of apomorphine. You will have a plan for use of the medication going forward.

### What are the benefits?

- Apomorphine injections can be a “rescue” treatment. It works quickly and it lasts for a short time. It can be taken if tablets haven’t kicked in yet or have worn off.
- Apomorphine can improve quality of life. It can allow some people to keep working or continue other activities longer.

### What are the possible risks or side effects?

_Many side effects of apomorphine are typical for dopamine agonists (such as apomorphine), and should be discussed with your specialist team:_

- Nausea or vomiting
  - You will likely be given anti-nausea medication to start a few days before your trial of apomorphine and to continue taking for a short time while using the medication.
- Sleepiness
- Hallucinations
- Problems with blood pressure
- Changes in behaviour known as ‘impulse control disorders’ (see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/impulsive-behaviours" class="internal-link">_Impulsive Behaviours_</a> page for more information).
- Overuse of medication. This can lead to dopamine dysregulation syndrome.

### What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?

When you start apomorphine injections you will be given details for who to contact if there is a problem. This may be a trained community nurse or the team at the specialist centre. You should carry the details of your treatment and your specialist team on you to contact if necessary. If you experience side effects, discuss them with your specialist team as soon as they occur.

## Apomorphine pump

### What is it?

Apomorphine (a dopamine agonist) is delivered continuously via a small pump. The pump has a small needle which is inserted under the skin. It tends to be given during daytime hours and stopped at night.

### Who is it for?

You may be able to have an apomorphine pump if:

- You have problems with <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/involuntary-movements" class="internal-link">_Involuntary Movements (Dyskinesia)_</a>.
- Your tablet medication has stopped working so well. For example, you have multiple ’off’ periods.

It is not likely to improve people beyond their current best and will not get rid of all motor symptoms. The goal of this treatment is to improve a person’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. It aims to give people a better quality of life.

### What should I expect from the assessment process?

Similar to the apomorphine injection process described above.

### What does using an apomorphine pump involve?

A new needle is inserted each day. The medication is delivered through the needle, a small flexible tube, syringe and pump. The needle is often inserted into the skin of the tummy or the front of the thigh. Apomorphine is usually infused through the waking hours at a set rate. The pump is then disconnected at night.

### What are the possible benefits?

- Once the pump is on a stable dose and you feel well, it might be possible to reduce your tablet doses.
- You may experience fewer and less severe “off” periods.
- Apomorphine can improve quality of life. It can allow some people to keep working or continue other activities longer.

### What are the possible risks?

The most common risk is skin nodule formation (small lumps under the skin). This occurs in most people with the pump. Things that may help to prevent this are excellent hygiene and proper needle insertion and rotation. Lumps may also be treated using ultrasound. You will also be required to undertake regular blood checks.

Other possible side effects include:  
_Many side effects of apomorphine are typical for dopamine agonists, and should be discussed with your specialist team:_

- Nausea and vomiting
  - You will likely be given anti-nausea medication to start a few days before your trial of apomorphine and to continue taking for a short time while using the medication.
- Hallucinations
- Sleepiness
- Blood pressure problems
- Changes in behaviour known as ‘impulse control disorders’ (see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/impulsive-behaviours" class="internal-link">_Impulsive Behaviours_</a> page for more information).

## Deep Brain Stimulation

### What is it?

<div class="video-container">

</div>

Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is used in specific cases to treat tremor or other movement problems in Parkinson’s. Electrodes which give electrical impulses are placed in certain areas of the brain. Wires connect the electrodes to a pulse generator, usually implanted in the chest. This pulse generator runs on battery and is set up by a specialist to deliver electrical energy to ease symptoms.

DBS is not a cure; it does not slow the progression of Parkinson’s.

### Who is it for?

You may be considered for DBS if you:

- are diagnosed with typical or idiopathic Parkinson’s;
- don’t have significant memory or mood problems;
- have specific movement problems (motor fluctuations or dyskinesia) despite medication changes;
- can travel to the specialist centre that looks after DBS. There will be lifelong follow-up appointments; and
- have symptoms that get better with levodopa. Symptoms that don’t get better with levodopa typically don’t improve with DBS.

**Symptoms that _don’t_ tend to get better with DBS (if they don’t improve with levodopa):**

- Speaking problems
- Swallowing problems
- Some balance problems (loss of postural reflexes)
- ‘Freezing’ that occurs when you are otherwise moving well
- Apathy
- Drooling of saliva
- Constipation
- Sleep disturbances
- Low mood
- Memory or thinking problems


For more information about these symptoms, see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Mananging Symptoms_</a> pages.



### What should I expect from the assessment process?

Deep Brain Stimulation is a highly specialised treatment that is only done at specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital. If your Parkinson’s specialist team think it might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a specialist centre. Please be aware there are often long waiting times before you get an appointment.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/neurologist.jpg" alt="DBS-appointment" class="example-class">


The initial appointment is to see if the specialists think it might be a good treatment for you and to discuss it with you in more detail.

If they think it could be a good treatment for you, and you wish to proceed, there will be an assessment process at the specialist centre. This is likely to involve:

- Assessment of your Parkinson’s (‘motor’ and ‘non-motor’ problems), including memory and thinking.
- Assessment of your response to levodopa.
- Assessment of your suitability for the surgical procedure and the required scans.
- Scans of your brain.

If you have DBS, you will need to have follow-up appointments for many years after surgery. This is for the purpose of programming and battery checks.

### What does the procedure involve?

- This procedure is typically done under local anaesthetic.
- A frame is put around your head, so it stays still.
- MRI scans are done to map out the head and locate the target areas of the brain.
- Two holes are made, and electrodes are carefully placed in the target areas.
- Wires from the electrodes are inserted under the skin. They are not usually connected to the pulse generator until a period of time after the electrodes are placed.
- The pulse generator is surgically placed on the chest or stomach area.
- Adjustments to the stimulation of the electrodes tend to be required more frequently in the first few months after surgery.
- The batteries on the pulse generator will need to be surgically replaced every few years.

### What are the intended benefits?

This depends on the area of the brain that is being stimulated. Mostly, the main goal is to increase time spent at your best (‘on’ time). As such, it may improve your ability to carry out day-to-day activities. It is not expected to improve someone beyond their current best, or get rid of all movement problems.

Other possible benefits:

- May reduce severe involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’)
- May reduce time when movements are less free (‘off’ time)
- May improve the severity of movements during ‘off’ time
- May reduce the time when movements are freer but troubled by involuntary movements (‘on time dyskinesia’)

### Potential Risks of DBS

There are potential risks related to:

- The surgical procedure: For example, bleeding in the brain or infection of any part of the device.
- The electrodes: For example, if the electrodes move or stop working.
- The stimulation: Side effects most commonly occur directly after the operation and often settle down after a few weeks. Other symptoms are longer lasting but may improve with changes in medication or the stimulation settings. For example, it can cause:
  - Slurred or slowed speech
  - Weight gain
  - Apathy
  - Difficulty opening your eyelids
  - Involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’)
  - Mood changes

### What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?

The specialist centre where you had the surgery will continue your follow-up care. They will provide you with details of your DBS device and contact details in case of any problems. You should carry these details with you so that the specialist team can be contacted in an emergency.

The settings of your stimulator can be adjusted to provide the best results. Adjustments usually occur in the weeks following your surgery and at follow-up appointments as your requirements change.

## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:

> “We always came back to the fact that if we’ve tried medication and I still had problems, there’s the operation. We Googled it and my son found out about it. I didn’t want to have the operation because I thought it was too risky. But then it came to a stage where I thought yes, I have to have that. I had the professor who was really good, and then the Parkinson’s nurse. They were really helpful and kind of guided me, saying, you know, ‘Now’s the time for you to have the surgery because your body is sort of showing you that it’s not lasting enough on the tablets and then surgery’s an option if you want to go for it.’ Because you think, ‘Well I went into every avenue of the pills.’ I saw videos of the operation, of the DBS system.  
So once I had the operation, you know, I could talk to you now probably longer than before. And now I’m more able to sort of express myself in an easy speech. It’s a bit better since I had the stimulator put in. And then the, doing things without getting tired too much.  
Like they said, the operation will manage your symptoms and that’s what it’s doing. I’m managing my symptoms better than I was without the operation. They gave me quite a lot of support, the DBS team.”

## Ultrasound

This method is currently under research for the treatment of tremor. It is not yet available for general use.

## Duodopa Infusion

### What is it?

Duodopa is a gel form of levodopa that is pumped directly into the gut, where levodopa is best absorbed. A tube is surgically inserted from outside the body, through the skin, into the stomach, and then into the required part of the gut. The tube remains in place long-term, and the person (and/or carer) will be taught how to care for it.

A pump regulates the amount of medication delivered. The pump is usually worn for 16 hours per day and disconnected for 8 hours. Medication packs are kept in the fridge when not in use.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/duopoda-2.jpg" alt="duodopa" class="example-class">


### Who is it for?

You may be able to have Duodopa infusion if: 
- You are diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have specific difficulties, such as:
  - Significant periods where the medication has become less effective, ‘off’ periods.
  - Disabling involuntary movements, ‘dyskinesias’, at times when the medication is otherwise working well.
- Your symptoms respond well to levodopa.
  - Symptoms that don’t get better with levodopa don’t tend to improve with Duodopa either. These may include problems with speaking, swallowing, falling due to loss of postural reflexes, or ‘freezing’ when the medication is otherwise working well (‘on’ periods). These may also include other non-motor symptoms such as apathy, drooling of saliva, constipation, or sleep disturbances, etc.
- You (or someone supporting you) are available to accept and immediately refrigerate deliveries of the medication. You must also have space to store the medication in the fridge. 

**Duodopa is not suitable if you have certain problems, including:**

- Significant dementia or psychotic symptoms
- Conditions that make the surgery high risk
- Problems which would prevent the person from being able to connect and disconnect the pump safely. This does not apply is there is someone else available to support you.

The goal of this treatment is to have people feel at their best for more of the time. Duodopa doesn’t make people better than their current best other than potentially reducing dykinesias. 

### What should I expect from the assessment process

Duodopa is a highly specialised treatment that is only managed at specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital. If your Parkinson’s team think it might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a specialist centre. Please be aware there are often long waiting times before you get an appointment. The first appointment is to see if the specialists also think it might be a good treatment for you and to discuss it with you in more detail. 
 
If they think it might be a good treatment for you, and you wish to proceed, there will be an assessment process at the specialist centre. This is likely to involve: 

- Assessment of your symptoms (‘motor’ and ‘non-motor’), memory and thinking.
- Assessment of your body response to levodopa.
- Assessment of your suitability for the surgery.
- Discussion about how you would manage the medication and care of the tube. 

### What does the procedure involve?

The process may be different in different hospitals. Some hospitals arrange a planned hospital stay to trial the medication before going ahead. For the trial, the medication may be given through a temporary tube that is inserted through the nose, down into the gut. This is called a nasogastric tube.

If the trial goes well, then the long term ‘jejunostomy’ tube is inserted and the nasogastric tube is removed. The jejunostomy tube is usually inserted one of two ways: 

  1.	A camera is inserted from the mouth down the food pipe to guide where the cut should be made for the tube. 
  2.	Special x-rays used to guide placement.

The tube connects from outside the body, through the skin into the stomach and is extended on the inside to reach the required part of the gut (sometimes called PEG-J). 
 
In general, these procedures are done using local anaesthetic injection into the skin where the cut will be made. Sedating medicine is given via a drip. 
 
Once the tube is safe to use, tablet medications are reduced down and discontinued as the Duodopa dose is optimised. Some people still need some tablet medication, particularly for the nighttime. 

### What are the intended benefits?

- Less ‘off’ time, more ‘on’ time
- Reduced dyskinesia
- Reduced oral medications
- Improved quality of life

### What are the potential risks?

- Early risks include problems with the procedure, such as pain, site infection, and tube detachment.
- Other risks include problems with the tube, such as blockages, or issues with the skin around the tube.
- Longer term problems include weight loss and low vitamin B12 levels (this can cause problems with nerve function).


### What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?

You will need long term follow-up at the specialist centre for your Duodopa treatment. 
 When you have the procedure and are set up with the equipment, you will be given contact details for who to contact if there are any problems. You should carry the details of your treatment on you so that the specialist team can be contacted if there is an emergency.
