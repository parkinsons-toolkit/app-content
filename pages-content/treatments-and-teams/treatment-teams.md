Treatment & Teams
Who May Be Involved?
You may come across a wide range of professionals. This is referred to as a “Multi-
Disciplinary Team” (MDT) approach. Who is involved will depend on your
particular circumstances and condition. This page aims to help you understand
how the system works, and who does what.
Individuals: Who’s who?
This explains the roles of the kinds of professionals you might come across. The
professionals listed below may work in GP surgeries, community services or in
hospitals. You may also meet students for each profession. They work under the
supervision of fully qualified staff. Many places of work have coded uniforms to
indicate role. If you are not sure who someone is, just ask. See extra information
below each role to find out more.

medical care, whether that be a new illness, a long
term one, or preventing illness. This includes physical
and mental health for people of all ages.

based in a hospital, though there is variation in who provides this.
- Neurologist. A doctor with a focus on conditions affecting the “nervous system”
(e.g. the brain, spinal cord and nerves)
- Geriatrician. A doctor with a focus on the care of older adults.
- For both of these, there can be some doctors that have a sub-specialty focus and
expertise. This could be in Parkinson’s and related conditions, Movement
Disorders. It is recommended that people with Parkinson’s have a regular and
stable point of contact. This would be a trusted source of information specific to
Parkinson’s. In many teams this would be provided by a specialist nurse.
- Parkinson’s Disease Nurse Specialist (PDNS). This is a nurse specialist practitioner
who can assess and manage symptoms of and medication used in Parkinson’s. They
can provide advice and support, with timely responses to problems. Some PDNSs
can prescribe medication. Some of them but not all will make home visits as part
of their role, usually when they are community-based, whereas others can provide
care during a hospital admission, usually when they are hospital-based.
Other Specialities
There are more than 60 specialties, but the following are the more common
specialties to be involved. They may be based in hospitals or in community
services. . See extra information below each name for more details.
- Accident & Emergency (A&E) o Broad remit as this can include people of all ages
with any condition. Their expertise lies in the emergency and urgent aspects of
care. Part of this involves determining where someone is best treated, e.g. in
hospital or at home.
- Neurosurgery o Specialists in procedures on the nervous system (e.g. the brain,
spinal cords, and nerves). Some advanced treatments used for Parkinson’s involve
brain surgery. This would be done by Neurosurgeons.

kidneys and the tubes between them. They may be involved for example, for
problems with bladder control.
- Psychiatry o Specialists in mental health so may be involved, for example, for

qualification). This is different from psychologists as described
above (have a psychology qualification), but they often work
together.

control for a range of different health conditions. o The aim of palliative care is to
help you to have a good quality of life.
- They also have expertise in care in later stages of life, but palliative
care is not just about end of life.
Organisational Level
In the UK, there is a split between Healthcare (National Health Service, NHS) and
Social Care (or Social Services). Note the financial comments apply to people living
in the UK (those with “ordinary residence”). There may be a charge for overseas
visitors. See the NHS website for more details on who is in entitled to NHS services.
Healthcare
- This is free at the point of access.
- It provides prevention, control or treatment of illness, injury or disability, and care
of these. This can be:
- GP check-up o Hospital care o Physiotherapy
- In healthcare, services are split into o Primary Care. This is the first point of
contact, i.e. your GP or an A&E.
- Secondary Care. This is hospital and community care. It can be planned,
urgent or emergency. It follows a referral from primary care.
- Tertiary Care. These are very specialised services, e.g. neurosurgery.
This follows a referral from secondary care.
- Some services are commissioned at a national level. Others can be at a local level.
This means there can be differences in services by area.
Social Care
- This is financially assessed. It depends on your income and savings.
- It provides assistance with day-to-day activities and social interaction. It
promotes independence and contribution to society, and protects vulnerable
people. This can be:
- Carers coming to your home to help you wash and dress o Supported
living environments o Assistance with home adaptations
- There are some cases where provision for social care needs are covered by the
NHS. This is known as Continuing Healthcare (CHC). Please see the Finances
page for more information. Private Healthcare
- There are many options for healthcare through the private
sector.
- The waiting times are often shorter, but there is a fee. This
can be substantial if you are not covered by a private
insurance plan.
- If you are due to be referred to another service and would
prefer to go privately, do tell the person making the referral.
- Some private services are covered by private health insurance. If you are
unsure, contact your insurance provider to find out what is covered.
- In most cases, to access private services and have this paid under insurance,
you still need a referral from your GP.
- Accessing private healthcare does not stop your entitlement to NHS
healthcare, but they must be separate. The NHS does not subsidise private
healthcare.
- If you do chose to pursue private healthcare, here are a few considerations:
- Ensure they are the profession that you are seeking, for example:
- Dietitians and nutritionists are not the same
- Psychologists, psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not the
same
(See details of professional roles given above)
- Look up the expertise of the provider. For example, does a private
doctor have specialist expertise in Parkinson’s?
- Check that the provider is registered.
- Most healthcare providers are legally required to be registered
with a regulatory body as listed for each profession above.
- The Professional Standards Authority holds a list of accredited
voluntary registers which they have independently assessed
against their own standards. They cover professions that are not
regulated by law, such as psychotherapists.
- Review the reports for the provider by the Care Quality Commission
(CQC) – website below. o Some professionals work across both NHS and
private services whereas others just work in one.
- More information is available on the NHS website.
- Resources for finding services are listed on the Further Support page.

Private Social Care
As indicated above, social care is not necessarily provided as a free public service.
To request a Needs Assessment, Contact your local council Adult Social Care
department. If care is recommended, they will conduct a Financial Assessment.
This determines if the council will contribute to the cost or not.
For resources to help find care and support, please see the Further Support page.
Home Help
‘Home Help’ refers to support for domestic tasks such as laundry, washing up and
cleaning. This is not usually provided by local councils, though they may be able
to recommend local providers. Many charities offer these services, some have a
charge.
Home Care
‘Home Care’ refers to support for personal tasks
such as showering, dressing and preparing meals.
The options for arranging this:
- If the council are contributing (following
financial assessment), they can arrange
Home Care for you.
- If the council are contributing (following
financial assessment), you can request
‘direct payment’ of your personal budget Image: Freepik.com and arrange the
Home Care yourself.
- If the council are not contributing (following financial assessment), you will
need to arrange Home Care yourself, with support from the council.
- You can choose to arrange your own Home Care without contacting the
council.
Home Care workers can either be:
c. Through a Home Care Agency. Agencies arrange for trained carers to visit
you in your home, but it may not always be the same carer. The agency
c. holds responsibility as the employer of the carer. The agency must be
registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
Or
d. Directly employed by you. This way you know who you are getting, but
you have legal responsibility as an employer. You will need to plan for the
Home Care Worker’s holiday and sickness. Note employer responsibility is
yours if you directly employ the carer, even if you receive financial support
from the council. Note individual Home Care Workers do not have to be
registered with a regulatory body.
See the Daily Living page to see advice on how to find Home Care workers.
See the Legal Matters page to see more about responsibilities as an employer.

Medication
There are a range of medicines available to help
manage the symptoms of Parkinson’s. At present,
no medication is known to change or cure the
underlying disease process. However, medication
can effectively improve the symptoms. Treating
symptoms earlier will help you to keep well and
active which is beneficial in the longer term.
Medicine can be adjusted to match your own
symptoms, needs and preferences.
The underlying changes in Parkinson’s are complex. One characteristic of
Parkinson’s is reduced levels of dopamine. This is a chemical messenger in the
brain. Most of the medicines for Parkinson’s work in different ways to improve
dopamine messaging.
It can take some time to find the best medicine regime for you. Symptoms change,
so your regime may need to change as well. Your Parkinson’s specialist team will
work with you to adjust medication and optimise symptom control.
It is important not to change your medication without discussing this with your GP
or Parkinson’s team first. Any withdrawal from Parkinson’s drugs must be done
gradually.
Commonly Used Medications
The Symptom Management pages have guidance for dealing with the side effects
that are listed below. If you experience side effects, consult these pages and speak
to your Parkinson’s specialist team. There are also other possible side effects that
can occur. Some medications cannot be used together with other medications.
Your prescribing doctor will take this into account when prescribing medication.
1. Levodopa Medications
What does it do?
- Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the body
