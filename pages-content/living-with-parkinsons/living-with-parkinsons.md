# Living with Parkinson's

In this **Living with Parkinson's** section, you will find information on a variety of topics relevant to those living with Parkinson’s. Below is a quick summary of each page available in this section:

- **Optimising Wellbeing** explores a self-management approach to Parkinson’s, to empower you to be your best. Every day you make choices that impact on your health and well-being: from what you do, to what you eat, to whom you see. This section gives guidance on things you can do to help you live well with Parkinson’s, and covers topics ranging from eating well and exercise, to stress management and emotional well-being strategies.

  The advice to keep active, eat well and stay social is, of course, applicable to everyone. The guidance in this section is intended to help you continue to lead a full life after your Parkinson’s diagnosis, with any challenges it presents. We also want to highlight the current research showing the extent to which exercise can improve mobility and overall quality of life in people with Parkinson’s.

  It also includes a <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/lifestyle-factors" class="internal-link">Lifestyle Factors</a> subsection, which offers general medical recommendations to improve long-term health, such as bone health and blood pressure management.

- **Practical Advice** Parkinson’s can affect day-to-day activities. But, there is lots of support available and there are many strategies you can try yourself. This section is about being aware of your options and ‘problem solving’ rather than medical aspects.

  Remember, asking for help is not a weakness. Part of managing your condition involves knowing when and how to find help. Asking for help can be difficult, but most people want to be helpful but may not know how.

  This page addresses many practical issues you may come across when living with Parkinson’s, including:

  The information on the Practical Advice pages was correct at the time of publishing. **Live Well with Parkinson’s** does not take responsibility for the accuracy of information within these pages or that found by visiting a link on this site.

- **Planning and Future Care** guides you through planning for the future, a process that often involves conversations with you, your family and healthcare professionals. Thinking about the future can be scary, but one way of dealing with the fear is to take control and plan for it. Everyone gets older. Anyone can become seriously ill. The uncertainty of those situations can be less frightening if you have prepared for them in advance.

  **“Good Housekeeping”**

  - Consider and convey your wishes
  - Write a will
  - Appoint a Lasting Power of Attorney
  - Organise your documents

  The practical aspects of these topics are discussed in the Practical Advice section under <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">Legal Matters</a>. Here we provide guidance on **things to consider for the future**. There are a lot of reasons why people find themselves unable to make or share their decisions. In such cases those around them have to take decisions on their behalf. Whether you have Parkinson’s or not, recording your future wishes is a way to make sure they can be considered when decisions about your care are made. Thinking ahead, and sharing your thoughts and wishes with family, friends and care professionals can help make sure decisions are based on your personal wishes.

  Part of planning for your future may include considering ‘palliative’ and ‘end-of-life’ care options.

  **What is palliative care?**
  Palliative care is treatment, care and support for people with a life-limiting illness. The aim of palliative care is to help you to have a good quality of life – this includes being as well and active as possible. It can involve:

  - managing physical symptoms such as pain
  - emotional, spiritual and psychological support
  - social care, including help with things like washing, dressing or eating
  - support for your family and friends.

  A life-limiting illness is an illness that cannot be cured. You can receive palliative care at any stage in your illness. Having palliative care does not necessarily mean that you’re likely to die soon – some people receive palliative care for years. You can also have palliative care alongside treatments, therapies and medicines aimed at controlling your illness.

  **What is end of life care?**
  End of life care involves treatment, care and support for people who are nearing the end of their life. It is an important part of palliative care. It is for people who are thought to be in the last year of life, but this timeframe can be difficult to predict. Some people might only receive end of life care in their last weeks or days.
