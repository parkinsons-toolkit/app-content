# Who May Be Involved?
Parkinson’s care often involves a **Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT)** approach, meaning multiple healthcare professionals work together to manage your care. As such, you may come across a wide range of professionals, and the team members you meet will depend on your individual needs and condition.

Throughout your Parkinson’s journey, your health professionals, including your GP or specialist, may ask for other professionals to be involved in your care. This will vary between individuals living with Parkinson’s depending on the symptoms and challenges they experience. Read on to learn more about which specialists maybe involved if you need them.

## Individuals: Who’s Who?
This section explains the roles of professionals you might come across. The individuals listed below may work in GP surgeries, community services, or hospitals. You may also meet students training in these professions; they work under the supervision of fully qualified staff. Many workplaces use colour-coded uniforms to indicate roles. If you're unsure who someone is, just ask. You’ll find extra information below each role to help you learn more.

### Dietitians

- Healthcare professionals that are trained in the science and everyday management of nutrition.
- They use the most up-to-date public health and scientific research on food, health and disease. They translate this into practical guidance to enable people to make appropriate lifestyle and food choices.
- They must be registered with the Health and Care 
Professions Council (HCPC) to work as a dietician in the UK. 

Please note a _nutritionist_ is not the same as a _dietitian_ (though some nutritionists are registered dietitians). A qualified nutritionist will have knowledge about nutrition. However, they may not be trained to give individual dietary advice to people with medical conditions. Nutritionists are not legally required to be registered as above, though many are on voluntary registers.

### Doctors
- Must be registered with the General Medical Council (GMC) to practice in the UK. They are required to maintain their knowledge and skill.

They have completed the required training and are registered as a specialist. May be hospital or community based. It takes at least 12 years to become a consultant, depending on the topic.
- **Consultants:** Specialists with advanced knowledge in a narrower area. They have completed the required training and are registered as a specialist. May be hospital or community based. It takes at least 12 years to become a consultant, depending on the topic.
- **Junior Doctors:** Qualified doctors but gaining experience in a particular area. This is a broad term that encompasses a range of experience, as specialty training takes many years. It includes all qualified doctors who are not consultants or GPs such as:
  - 'Registrar' or 'Specialty Trainees' is the step before becoming a GP or consultant, so they work in a particular area.
  - 'Foundation Doctors' are in their first two years of training after graduating from university medical school. They will be gaining broad experience across a range of specialties and settings.
  - Other terms that you may see include ‘Fellow’, ‘Trust Grade’ or ‘Associate Specialist’.

# Organisational Level: Healthcare and Social Care in the UK

In the UK, healthcare and social care are **separate systems**. Costs, access, and services differ depending on whether care is provided by the **NHS**, local councils, or privately.

---

## Healthcare

- **Free at the point of access** for UK residents. Overseas visitors may be charged.
- Covers **prevention, treatment, and care** for illness, injury, or disability. Examples include GP check-ups, hospital care, and physiotherapy.
- Services are split into levels:
  - **Primary Care:** First point of contact (GPs, A&E).
  - **Secondary Care:** Hospital and community care following referral from primary care. Can be planned, urgent, or emergency.
  - **Tertiary Care:** Highly specialized services (e.g., neurosurgery) following referral from secondary care.
- Some services are commissioned nationally, others locally. Availability may vary by area.

---

## Social Care

- **Financially assessed** based on income and savings.
- Provides **support for daily living and social interaction**, promoting independence and protecting vulnerable people. Examples include:
  - Home care for washing, dressing, and meals
  - Supported living environments
  - Home adaptations
- Some needs may be covered by the NHS under **Continuing Healthcare (CHC)**.

---

## Private Healthcare

- Offers **shorter waiting times** but at a fee (unless covered by insurance).
- To access via insurance, referrals from a GP are usually needed.
- Accessing private healthcare **does not affect NHS entitlement**, but the services are separate.
- Considerations for private care:
  - Ensure the professional matches your needs (e.g., dietitian vs nutritionist, psychologist vs psychotherapist vs psychiatrist).
  - Verify expertise, registration, and regulatory compliance.
  - Check provider ratings with the **Care Quality Commission (CQC)**.

---

## Private Social Care

- Arrange a **Needs Assessment** through your local council Adult Social Care department.
- If eligible, a **Financial Assessment** determines council contribution.
