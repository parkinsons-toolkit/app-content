Hobbies and pets provide many people with a sense of purpose and enjoyment. Hobbies enable us to enjoy an activity that is a break from our day-to-day routine. For many people it helps to keep on doing hobbies or start new ones, no matter your age or circumstances. It is seen as a way to keep up or improve your wellbeing.

Having a pet can also help to improve wellbeing. When diagnosed with Parkinson’s, there may be some challenges in taking part in hobbies or looking after a pet in the ways that we used to. Lots of people with Parkinson’s still enjoy their hobbies and look after their pets for many years. This information sheet provides tips and advice on how best to maintain your hobbies and take care of your pets in these new circumstances.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

At times your Parkinson’s might affect your ability to enjoy your hobbies. This might be due to problems getting about (mobility), or tremors or other symptoms. But, for your own physical and mental wellbeing, it’s important that Parkinson’s doesn’t become the sole focus of your life. Even if you are finding your hobby more difficult, there are often ways you can continue to enjoy the activity. This might be by speaking to an occupational therapist or thinking of ways to adapt the activity to make it easier for you. So, try to continue doing your hobbies or take on new ones that you enjoy, whatever they may be. Below we outline some things you can try yourself and what support is available.

## What can I try?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/tennis.jpg" alt="tennis" class="hobbies-and-pets__tennis">

There are many reasons why it’s important to maintain a hobby or find a new one. For example, it gives you a chance to socialise with other people who may have similar interests. It also provides a mental escape and an opportunity to take a break from daily tasks. Doing something you enjoy has been shown to reduce stress and benefit your wellbeing.

There are several tips that may help you to continue with different hobbies:

### Plan ahead

- Plan ahead for specific days and times you are going to enjoy your hobbies. Think about what time of day you will most enjoy doing the activity.
- <ins>Example:</ins> If your mind feels clearer and your mobility tends to be better in the morning, plan activities for then rather than in the afternoon or evening.
- If getting to your activity is difficult, see our <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/travel" class="internal-link">Travel</a> page for ideas to make this easier, such as the blue badge scheme for parking.
- If you need to have access to toilets to do your activity, see our <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/urination" class="internal-link">Urinary Symptoms</a> section for information on the ‘Radar key’ scheme for accessible toilets, and other tips.
- If stairs are difficult, there are resources online and Apps that allow you to check which venues are accessible in your local area (e.g., <a href="https://www.accessable.co.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AccessAble</a>). Some sites now also clearly label accessible countryside walks (e.g., <a href="https://www.ramblers.org.uk/advice/walking-with-a-disability-or-health-issue/people-with-limited-mobility-and-wheelchair-users.aspx" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ramblers - walking with a disability</a>).

### Have a back-up plan

- There are times when you may have “good days” and “bad days”. Have a back-up plan for an activity that you can still enjoy on days you can’t do the activity you had planned.
  - </ins>Example:</ins> you enjoy reading but sometimes find it hard to turn the pages or focus on the writing. Your back-up plan is to use an audiobook where you can listen to a story.

### Allow more time

- Allow more time for your activity as it may take longer for you to do it than before.
  - <ins>Example:</ins> Your hobby involves walking, such as countryside walks or visiting museums. It may be best to allow more time as you may not walk at the same speed as previously or you may get tired faster.

### Think about ways you can change the activity

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/gym.jpg" alt="gym" class="hobbies-and-pets__gym">

- There may come a time when doing an activity, you love is too difficult. Take time to think about ways you can change the activity while keeping it similar enough for you to enjoy.
  - <ins>Example:</ins> You enjoy cycling and are part of a social group. But balancing on the bike is now difficult. You could think about alternatives such as joining an indoor spin class or indoor cycling group. This way, you can still enjoy the social aspect and the benefit of cycling without the risk of losing balance on a road.

### Involve other people

- You may find it difficult to perform a hobby to the level that you once could. It may be enjoyable and helpful to involve other people in the hobbies you enjoy.
  - <ins>Example:</ins> Your hobby is something that requires a high level of skill such as playing the piano, knitting, or woodwork. You could spend time with family or friends completing these tasks together or teaching them how to do it. This will also provide a meaningful and enjoyable way to spend time together.

### Try new activities

- Take time to try new activities and see if you find them enjoyable.
  - <ins>Example:</ins> You’ve not done much gardening before as you’ve struggled to find the time but it’s something that interests you. You may find joining a social gardening club quite relaxing and pleasurable.

### Try creative hobbies - Join a Parkinson’s specific social group

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/golf-with-friends.jpg" alt="golf-with-friends" class="hobbies-and-pets__golf-with-friends">

- You may find it helpful to meet up with other people in groups for living with Parkinson’s. For example, if you’re feeling frustrated because you’re no longer able to do an activity to the level you once could, other people may be able to share how they manage this. By attending a Parkinson’s specific group, you can talk to, and share advice with, others who have been in a similar situation to you. The organisers of these social groups will also have experience of being able to adapt activities to help you make them more enjoyable again.
  - <ins>Example:</ins> You enjoy golf but are finding it more difficult to get around the course due to problems walking. In some areas there are indoor golf groups designed for people who are older or have Parkinson’s. Instead of playing 18 full holes, members take part in putting tournaments or mini- golf with adapted golf clubs (e.g. clubs with extra wide grip). Not everyone takes part, some are happy to watch and comment.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I think Parkinson’s groups are great. I think they’re great socially. They’re great in terms of finding out about benefits that an individual may not know about, accessing services that they either do or don’t know about but don’t know how to access.”  
> (Person with Parkinson’s)

## What support is available?

### Parkinson’s UK

Parkinson’s UK is a charity that helps you find local activities and groups that might be of interest to you. The groups and activities available depend on where you live. You can either search online through their website or phone them. The groups range from activities organised for people with Parkinson’s to groups that are open to everyone (e.g. gardening club, singing, and yoga).

To find your local Parkinson’s social groups, visit the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> website and enter your postcode using their dedicated search tool.

### Occupational therapists

Occupational therapists may be able to work with you to help maintain your health and independence. They may show you different ways to make activities or hobbies easier or suggest adapted equipment to help you. Contact your GP or local authority (council) adult services department and ask about an assessment. This also applies to getting help with social care needs.

## Caring for pets

Anyone who has a pet, will know that pets become an integral part of a family. Whether you already have a pet or are thinking about getting a pet, there are several things to consider. There are many benefits to having a pet, but pets do come with some challenges. This section will discuss these benefits and provide advice on how to care for a pet and seek support, if needed.

### Benefits of having a pet

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/man-with-dog.jpg" alt="man-and-dog" class="hobbies-and-pets__man-with-dog">

- **Companionship** — Having a pet can reduce feelings of isolation or loneliness if you live alone. Walking a dog can also be a great way of meeting new people: other people with dogs and people who just love to say hello to dogs.
- **Sense of responsibility** — Pets give many owners a sense of purpose and another reason to stay healthy.
- **Improved wellbeing** — Research has shown that having a pet is linked to reduced depression and improved wellbeing. Making sure that a pet is well cared for everyday can be very rewarding and also a reminder to look after yourself.
- **Increased activity** — Pets will almost always encourage you to be more active. The increased activity may just be an extra trip downstairs to let the cat out in the morning or a jog around the park with the dog. Regular exercise is linked to improved symptoms in people living with Parkinson’s.
- **Service dogs** — Dogs can be trained to help owners with Parkinson’s symptoms (e.g. helping you to keep balance). Service dogs can also alert other people if you have an accident at home. See <a href="https://www.assistancedogs.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assistance Dogs UK</a> for guidance on how to apply for a service dog. You can find more details and resources at the bottoms of this page.

### What can I try?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/dog.jpg" alt="woman-with-dog" class="hobbies-and-pets__dog">

If you are struggling to care for a pet alone, there are some strategies you can put in place to make it easier for yourself.

- **Timed food dispensers** — You can buy timed food dispensers that will open to the time that is set. This will allow you to put the food in and still provide your pet with regular feeding times even if you are out of the house or cannot keep to a routine.
- **Adaptive equipment** — There is general equipment that you can buy that makes jobs easier around the home when caring for a pet. For example, there are dog bowls with long handles that save you bending to pick up or put down their food bowl. For advice on more adaptive equipment contact the Blue Cross (more information below).
- **GPS trackers** — Can be attached to pets’ collars. They are a good way to locate your pet if he/she gets lost.
- **Ask your neighbour or family to help** — If it is difficult to care for your pet on your own for whatever reason, it may be sensible to ask for help. For example, you could ask your family or neighbour to pick up pet food, take your pet to the vet, or take it on walks. You may also consider employing a local dog walker and there are also doggie day care businesses for days when you are out all day. Getting early help from neighbours or family will help you to keep enjoying life with your pet.
- **Re-home pet with a family member** — Another option may be to have your pet live with a family member. You would need to discuss this with them to make sure they are happy with this. This way you should be able to continue seeing your pet but without the added responsibility of caring for him/her every day.
- **Get some support** — If there is no family or friends who can help, there are a number of organisations that might be able to help (see below).

## What support is available?

If it becomes too difficult for you to care for your pet by yourself, there is help that can support you and your pet.

### Blue Cross

**Reduced Veterinary Care Costs**
The <a href="https://www.bluecross.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blue Cross</a>, <a href="https://www.pdsa.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PDSA</a>, and <a href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSPCA</a> offer reduced veterinary care costs for people receiving certain means-tested benefits, which may include pension credit and disability living allowance.

If you decide to move to a care home or extra care housing, the Cinnamon Trust will try to help you find a home that accepts pets. Some care homes do take pets, so it is worth enquiring about this.

### Dogs Trust

<a href="https://www.dogstrust.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dogs Trust</a> can give you advice on getting a new dog or how to re-home your dog.

## Alternatives to owning a pet

You may want to have the benefits of being around pets without the responsibility of owning your own pet. If this is the case, there are options you can consider.

### Borrow My Doggy

- As mentioned above, <a href="https://www.borrowmydoggy.com/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Borrow My Doggy</a> allows you to spend time with dogs that other people in the local area own.
