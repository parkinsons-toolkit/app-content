# Diet and Parkinson’s

There is no diet that is specifically recommended for Parkinson’s, but diet can make a difference for symptoms related to Parkinson’s, such as overall mood, constipation, and blood pressure. Diet can also affect some of the medications used for Parkinson’s.

## What is a balanced diet in more detail?

* Eat a variety of food groups. Include a variety of foods from all components of the NHS Eatwell Guide for a range of nutrients. You can find this on page 49.
* Eat at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day.
* Base meals on starchy carbohydrates and try to opt for wholegrains where possible for fibre
* Include protein at each meal (e.g. beans, pulses, fish, eggs, and lean meat).
* Dairy and dairy alternatives for calcium – aim for 3 portions daily.
* Oils and spreads – choose one that is low is saturated fat (e.g. olive oil)
* Sugar and fat – try to cut down on these. Include in moderation (unless recommended by your healthcare professional)
* Fluid intake: aim for 6-8 glasses of non-alcoholic drinks per day for hydration (unless advised otherwise by your healthcare professional)

*For more details of the different food types, see section ‘Understanding food groups’.*

### 1. Levodopa and protein

Including Sinemet, Madopar, Stalevo.

Some people notice that when they eat a protein-rich meal and take levodopa at the same time, their levodopa doesn’t work as well – it doesn’t kick in as quickly or doesn’t last as long as usual. This may occur because levodopa and protein are absorbed in the same area of the intestine, so taking them at the same time may mean that less levodopa is absorbed or absorbed more slowly.

**Dietary advice:**

* You should not stop eating protein altogether.

  * Protein is vital to help your body renew itself and fight infection
  * Reducing protein may cause dangerous weight loss
* Some people find benefit from a “protein redistribution” diet: this is reducing protein intake around the time of levodopa. The medication could be taken with something low in protein, like a cracker, biscuit or fruit if nausea is a problem.
* Protein could then be eaten later (e.g. 30–60 mins after) or moved to a time when its impact on medication will be less of a problem (often towards the end of the day).
* Caution is advised with this to ensure adequate protein is still consumed.
* Research has looked at low protein diets and there is no adequate evidence to support recommending this.

If you think your symptoms are being affected by the interaction between medication and meals, try tracking your symptoms for 3–5 days, recording:

* When you take your medication
* What and when you eat
* What and when you experience symptoms.

You can then take this to your specialist Parkinson’s team or dietician to review your regime. *Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.*

You can record these things all in one place by using **My Tracker**.

*Examples of protein are provided in the section ‘Understanding food groups’.*

### 2. Dopamine agonists and food

Including pramipexole (e.g. Mirapexin), ropinirole (e.g. Requip), rotigotine (e.g. Neupro), apomorphine injections

This class of drugs doesn’t interact with protein the way levodopa does. It is important to discuss the medication schedule with your Parkinson’s specialist team and stay on the same daily schedule.

---

### 3. Selegiline and food

Selegeline (e.g. Eldepryl, Zelapar)

High blood pressure can occur when high-dose selegeline is taken with tyramine-rich foods. Examples of tyramine-rich food include:

* Mature cheese
* Salami
* Bovril, Oxo, Marmite, or any similar meat or yeast extract; or fermented soya bean extract
* Some beers, lagers or wines
* Tyramine also increases in leftover food stored longer than 48 hours
* Food that is spoiled (e.g. food that is past its “best before” date)

---

## Constipation

Constipation is a common symptom experienced by people with Parkinson’s. It can prevent medication from being absorbed properly, which prevents it from working properly. The first steps toward managing constipation are diet and lifestyle modifications.

* Stay hydrated
* Increase fibre intake (High fibre foods are listed at the end of this page)

*See the Bowel Symptoms page for more details.*

---

## Diet and low blood pressure

People with Parkinson’s can experience low blood pressure, particularly when changing positions from lying flat to sitting or from sitting to standing. Drops in blood pressure can make you feel dizzy, weak or lightheaded. Diet can affect these symptoms.

**Dietary advice:**

* Avoid large meals
* Reduce heavy carbohydrate and sugar food intake – this causes blood to divert to the stomach so the pressure goes down elsewhere
* Stay hydrated
* Reduce alcohol intake
* If drinking alcohol, look for lower alcohol versions. Ensure plenty of water intake alongside
* Avoid constipation (straining makes the problem worse)
* In some cases increased salt intake can help, but there are also potential harmful effects of high salt intake so discuss with your GP, dietician or Parkinson’s team before trying this.

*See the Dizziness page for more details.*

---

## Alcohol

Generally, unless you have been advised to not drink alcohol by a healthcare provider, a small amount of alcohol (a glass of wine or beer) every once in a while should not cause problems. Alcohol may make some Parkinson’s symptoms less noticeable for a time, but it can also cause other issues, such as:

* Lowering or raising blood pressure
* Disturbing sleep: It can make you sleepy initially, but also tends to cause a lighter, more restless sleep
* Worsen urinary symptoms, especially needing to go to the toilet at night
* Low mood and anxiety
* Affect your balance and increase risk of falls

**General alcohol intake recommendations** (lower levels may be more suitable given the issues above):

* Men and women are advised not to drink more than 14 units of alcohol a week on a regular basis
* It’s important to spread out alcoholic drinks during the week
* If you want to cut down, try to have several drink-free days each week
* You can find out more about alcohol units by visiting the NHS Live Well website, or the independent charity Drinkaware website. You can find links in our More Information section.

*Alcohol dependency or addiction has serious health implications. There is lots of support available – see the NHS website ([www.nhs.uk](http://www.nhs.uk)) to find your local alcohol addiction services.*

## Swallowing difficulties

Some people with Parkinson’s will notice they may have trouble with swallowing certain foods or liquids. Here we discuss the dietary implications; see Swallowing Difficulties page for more information about the symptom.

It is important to talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team as soon as you can if you are having problems with swallowing. They may need to refer you to specialists who can offer help. Speech and language therapists (SALTs or SLTs) are experts in swallowing and can offer information and strategies to overcome some of the challenges you are experiencing.

**Dietary advice:**

* Consider smaller, more frequent meals and snacks – or food that is easier to eat – note you can buy heated plates to keep food warm for longer if it takes you longer to eat.
* If you wear dentures, ensure they fit comfortably – ask for a review by your dentist if needed
* Try to eat when you are less tired, this may mean moving your main meal to lunchtime
* Try smaller mouthfuls
* Don’t drink through straws
* Softer food will be easier to eat
* Thin fluids (like water) are more difficult to swallow than thicker ones, so in some cases Speech & Language Therapists recommend using a powder to thicken fluids.
* Thicker soups, yoghurts or blended foods/fruits can also allow you to take in more fluid in a form that is easier to swallow.
* Smaller meals may not be as nutritionally complete, so if you are having issues with gaining or maintaining weight please consult your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.

## Maintaining healthy weight

It is important for everyone to maintain a healthy weight, as being overweight or underweight can affect your health. Changes in body weight can also affect how your body processes medication, so changes in weight may mean you need changes in medication dose.

The **body mass index (BMI)** is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. For most adults, a healthy BMI is in the 18.5–24.9 range.

* A BMI below 18.5 is classed in the underweight range
* A BMI between 25–29.9 is classed in the overweight range
* A BMI of ≥30 is classed in the obese range

Having a BMI outside of the ‘healthy’ range can have a negative impact on your health and should be discussed with your GP.

---

### Underweight

Weight loss is not part of normal ageing. Weight loss can be a sign of an underlying condition and may require investigation, but can also be due to Parkinson’s for a range of reasons.

*To find out more about weight loss and what you could do about it, see our Weight & Appetite Loss page.*

If you have lost a significant amount of weight without trying, then you should see your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.

**What is a significant amount of weight loss?**

* Approximately 3kg / 7lb or clothes no longer fitting over 6–12 months is significant, though it depends on your starting weight.
* 5% weight loss or more over 3–6 months is considered significant

**How to calculate % weight loss:**

```
Current weight - previous weight  
→ take this number x 100 / Previous weight
```

Example:

* Ms X weighs 70 kg now, and weighed 75 kg at her last check 5 months ago
* To get her score:
  `70kg – 75kg / 75kg = -0.0666 x 100 = 6.66%`
  → This is considered significant weight loss

---

### Overweight

Avoiding being overweight is particularly important if you have other health conditions in addition to Parkinson’s – for example, circulation problems, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease.

Parkinson’s doesn’t tend to make people gain weight, but there are few reasons why it can happen, specific to Parkinson’s:

1. It is easy to gain weight if you become less active but continue eating the same amount of food.
2. Compulsive eating – this is a rare side effect of some Parkinson’s medications, where the person experiences an irresistible urge to eat excessively. See our Impulsive Behaviours page for more information. If you think this is affecting you, please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.
3. Deep Brain Stimulation – some people experience weight gain after the surgery. Speak to your specialist team if you think this has been the case.

## Dietary Advice if You Have Been Advised to Lose Weight

* Don’t eat fried food regularly – try grilling, air frying, microwaving, baking, steaming, poaching, or boiling. Consider marinades, herbs, stock, and spices for flavour.
* Use skimmed or semi-skimmed milk instead of full fat
* Cakes, sweet biscuits and pastries all have lots of sugar and fat, so try to cut down – you could try switching them out for low sugar yoghurts, crumpets, teacakes, or fruit
* Use sugar-free, no added sugar or low calorie drinks
* Choose wholemeal carbohydrates where possible to help keep you full
* Ensure ½ your plate is vegetables/salad, ¼ lean protein and ¼ wholemeal or low GI carbohydrate
* Avoid very low calorie diets as this can contribute to decreased energy levels

---

## Supplements

The best way to get vitamins and minerals in your diet is by eating a well-balanced diet. For many vitamins and supplements, there isn’t clear evidence that they have health benefits, and in some cases, large doses can have side effects.

Some vitamins and supplements can interact with your Parkinson’s medications or other medications. Before purchasing any ‘over the counter’ mineral or vitamin supplements from chemists or health food shops, be sure to consult with a pharmacist, your GP, or Parkinson’s specialist team.

### Should I Take Supplements?

* If you are found to have low levels of certain vitamins or minerals you may be advised to take supplements for a time, but in most cases there are adequate nutrients in normal food intake.
* Those eating a strictly plant-based diet may require supplements, please discuss this with your GP
* In the UK, the exception to this is **vitamin D** which requires our skin to be exposed to the sun.

  * It is recommended that people with Parkinson’s take routine vitamin D supplements. This can be bought in most chemists or large supermarkets as **Vitamin D3**.
  * Some people will be getting vitamin D3 combined with a calcium supplement. If you take calcium supplements check with your GP first.
  * If you are found to have a low vitamin D level, then you should be prescribed additional higher dose vitamin D to bring it back up to normal and then continue the routine supplements.
* **Vitamin B12** and **folate** levels are sometimes lower in people with Parkinson’s

  * Low vitamin B12 can be associated with the medication levodopa
  * Low vitamin B12 is associated with nerve problems, called peripheral neuropathy. See our *5 Senses* page for more information on neuropathy.
  * Vitamin B12 is particularly likely to be lower in people with Parkinson’s who are receiving a gel form of levodopa given via a tube directly into the gut (an intraduodenal gel infusion called **Duodopa** – see our *Advanced & Surgical Treatments*)
  * More research is ongoing, but for now, people on Duodopa are recommended to take supplementary vitamin B12.

### Are There Supplements to Slow Parkinson’s?

There has been a lot of interest in supplements as a way of slowing down Parkinson’s, but at this time there has not been convincing scientific evidence to recommend them. This includes:

* Creatine
* High fibre supplement
* Co-enzyme Q10
* Trigonella foenum
* Amino acid supplementation
* Vitamin E
* Specific berries
* Coconut oil
* Antioxidants
* Inosine

---

### Cautions With Supplements

* **B6** reduces the effect of some Parkinson’s medications
* **Iron supplements** reduce the absorption of some Parkinson’s medications: It is advised to take them at different times
* **Coconut oil** is high in saturated fat which is bad for general health
* Excessive amounts of **antioxidant supplements** can be harmful
* **Calcium supplements** are advised in some cases, but not routinely recommended due to potential harm from high calcium levels. If you think you might need calcium, discuss this with your GP

---

## When to See a Dietician

* When you can no longer maintain your body weight after trying out the “underweight” dietary advice above
* If you have lost a significant amount of weight without trying, then you should see your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.

  * Approximately 3kg or 7lb or clothes no longer fitting, over 6–12 months is significant, though it depends on your starting weight
  * Try monitoring and writing down your weight every month – this will help you to monitor your own weight, but will also be useful for your GP/dietitian
  * Also, see section ‘Maintaining healthy weight’ for guidance on how to calculate a significant amount of weight loss
* If you notice other signs of weight loss this may be reason to see a dietitian:

  * Looser fitting clothes and/or belt
  * Jewellery no longer fitting
  * Looser fitting dentures

## Understanding Food Groups

You can learn more about the five food groups below by exploring the NHS Eatwell Guide, which you can find in our More Information section.

### Fruit / Vegetables

* Wide range of different coloured fruit and vegetables for wider range of vitamins and minerals
* Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables a day
* Can be fresh, frozen, tinned, dried, or juiced

### Starchy Carbohydrates

* Examples: bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, cereal
* Starchy food should make up just over a third of food eaten
* They are a good source of energy
* Choose wholemeal where possible

### Dairy

* Milk, cheese, yoghurt are important sources of calcium and good sources of protein
* **Non-dairy alternatives**: calcium-fortified soya milks, soya yoghurts and soya cheeses can make good alternatives. If using non-dairy alternatives, check labels as some won’t be fortified with calcium

### Protein

* Examples: beans, pulses, fish, eggs, meat, non-meat alternatives (e.g. Quorn)
* Good sources of protein, vitamins, minerals
* **Pulses** (beans, peas and lentils) are good meat alternatives because they are lower in fat and higher in fibre and protein
* Aim for **2 portions of fish every week**, 1 of which should be oily (e.g. salmon or mackerel)
* If you don’t eat fish, you can try including soybeans, walnuts, or linseeds and their oils in your diet

### Oils / Spreads

* **Unsaturated fats** are healthier fats

  * Examples include: vegetable, rapeseed, olive and sunflower oils
* All types of fat should be eaten sparingly

### Fluids

* Water, lower fat milks, and lower sugar or sugar-free drinks (including tea and coffee) all count

---

## Getting Required Nutrients

### Sources of Calcium

* Dairy
* Calcium-fortified non-dairy milk and dairy alternatives (check label, as some may not be fortified with calcium)
* Sardines / salmon (with bones)

### Sources of Vitamin D

Most vitamin D is obtained through the action of sunlight on the skin. The location of the UK, and the strength of the sun in the UK means that the skin can make vitamin D only between 11 am and 3 pm, during the months of April to October.

Foods high in vitamin D include:

* Oily fish like salmon, tuna, sardines, mackerel
* Fortified breakfast cereal
* Eggs
* Meat
* Fortified margarines and spreads
* Some powdered milks

Because it can be difficult to eat enough vitamin D, a daily **10 mcg supplement of vitamin D3** may be recommended by your dietitian or healthcare professional

---

### Sources of B Vitamins

* Breakfast cereals may be fortified with vitamins
* Nuts
* Meat
* Milk
* Eggs
* Fruit & vegetables
* Fortified bread
* Soya beans

---

## Vegan Diets

* If excluding meat and dairy from your diet, please discuss with a dietitian or healthcare professional to ensure your diet is nutritionally complete
* Note **vitamin B12** is found in most animal products but not in green plants, therefore **B12 supplement is recommended** if not eating animal products
