## Helpful tips when using the toolkit!

There are two key areas of the toolkit:

1. **Information** pages (**What is Parkinson’s**, **Newly Diagnosed**, **Treatments & Therapies**, **Managing Symptoms**, **Living with Parkinson’s**, **Research**, **Further Support**) – where you can click into each page for more information which might interest you.

_Tip: if there is something specific you are looking for and can’t find it, use the search box to type what you are looking for e.g., Medication. When you find the page, press Crtl + F. This will open a new search box where you can type the words you are looking for e.g. side effects._

2. **Personalised** pages – which are personal to you and allows you to record your symptoms, set objectives, and more.

- You can access these sections one of two ways, depending on what device you are using, by clicking one of the links along the top or by clicking **pencil icon** on the top right of the page.
- Helpful videos on how to use and make the most of each area of the toolkit can be found here (link) ‘Further Support’ ‘How to use this toolkit’. This page displays an overview of the contents of your personalised sections including your calendar of events.
- In the personalised section you will find:
  1. _**Symptom Review**_ (including your health conditions, medication, treatments, and research involvement, and a list of symptoms you experience and how bad you think they are)
  2. _**My Wellbeing**_ (to find the things you would like to keep doing or improve)
  3. _**My Tracker**_ (to keep a record of your medications, activities, and symptoms, which may help you to find patterns and understand your experiences)
  4. _**Reminders & Notes**_ (to allow you to store all your healthcare appointments in one place, to keep all your information in one place and can be used like a diary)
