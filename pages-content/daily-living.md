# Daily Living

- Also see our Mobility page for more advice on getting around.
  Grooming & dental care
  Shaving, brushing your hair, applying make-up or
  brushing your teeth can all become more difficult
  due to reduced dexterity or grip or additional
  movements like tremor or dyskinesia.
- Sit at the sink. Sitting on a perching stool or chair
  can help provide some extra stability.
- Resting your elbows on the sink edge can
  increase stability.
- Consider an electric toothbrush – most have a wider handle, can be heavier and require less detailed
  movement. You can also try foam tubing to widen the tooth brush handle.
- Brushing teeth to music can help.
- Consider an electric shave rather than a razor blade.
- Consider a wide brush handle over a small comb for brushing hair.

Managing dental hygiene is important for the health of your teeth and gums. Poor dental hygiene

can worsen symptoms, such as difficulties eating. See General Medical Advice section for more
on this.
Dressing

Dressing may become more difficult due to stiffness, reduced dexterity or difficulties balancing.
Reduced hand movements can affect fastenings, like buttons and zips.

- Allow yourself time to get dressed.

- Where possible sit to dress on the edge of the bed or chair.
- Try Velcro fastenings.
- Leave clothing items fastened where possible.
- Choose items with fewer buttons.
- Wear items that are slightly larger size, loose fitting or
  stretchy fabrics.
- Try a front fastening bra or bra top.
- Attach a fabric loop or pull to your zipper.
- Small aids such as a button hook may help.
- Elastic shoe laces can be easier.
- Try a long handled shoe horn to put shoes on.
  Using the toilet
  Getting up and to the toilet, and then getting up from the toilet again can be tricky
  if your movements are stiffer, slower or less well balanced. This is extra tricky if the toilet seat is
  lower than knee level.
  Reduced movements can also make it more difficult to clean yourself after using the toilet.
- Try to remove obstacles from your route to the toilet from your main living area.
- Some people find a ‘bottom wiper’, which is a long handle aid, helpful.
- Flushable moist toilet/wet wipes can help with this (although there are concerns these are not
  environmentally friendly, as can block narrow drainpipes and take a long time to disintegrate). toilet
  comes on suddenly or related symptoms. See the
  U rinary Symptoms and Bowel Symptoms pages for more tips.
  Movements in & around bed
  These may be tricky due to stiffness, reduced movements and balance problems.
- Satin sheets can help you turn over in bed o You can buy them either off-the-shelf satin sheets or
  specially designed sheets with satin panels (e.g. a panel of satin going across the middle of the bed
  where hips would rest)
- If you use satin sheets or panels, make sure there is an area of friction at either end or
  sides of the bed so you can get a grip on something
- Satin pyjamas can also help you turn in bed. o Don’t wear satin pyjamas at the same time as satin
  sheets – this will increase the risk of sliding out of bed too quickly.
- Light weight bedding is preferable.
  If the issue is about feeling weak or dizzy when getting out of bed, see the Dizziness symptom
  page for tips.
  Eating & drinking
  There are a range of steps with regards to food and drink:
- Grocery shopping may be more difficult due to reduced mobility or balance. o Consider online
  deliveries o Consider what services are available locally
- Consider teaming up with a friend or neighbour to do the shopping together
- Meal preparation may be hard due to reduced dexterity or grip, or tremor or dyskinesia.
  Difficulties in thinking can affect planning and can make cooking more
  difficult. o Cutlery with wider handles may be easier to use. o Special
  equipment has been developed for these difficulties – see below.
- You may find it easier to follow a recipe step-by-step and tick off as you go through.
- Handling food and drink may be more difficult for the same reasons:
- Cutlery with wider handles may be easier to use. o Consider the timing
  of your meals to avoid the times when your symptoms are worse.
- Consider sports bottles, cups that have a narrow nozzle, or cups with lids (e.g. travel cups
  or ‘sip cups’) to reduce the risk of spillages.
- Place foods or liquids in smaller containers to make them easier to grab and handle. For
  example, it’s easier to manage a pint of milk rather than a larger, heavier 4 pint milk
  carton.
- Special equipment has been developed for these difficulties – see below.
- For difficulties in swallowing, please see the Swallowing Difficulties symptom page.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“Maybe there’s things for people like my mum, she likes to stay independent – like
sometimes she’ll say ‘Do you know what, I want to cook today’, you know like electric tin
cutters and things like that to help make your life a bit easier.” (Carer of someone with
Parkinson’s)
Domestic tasks
Living with Parkinson’s can make daily activities and chores more difficult as the condition
progresses. If this is affecting you, there are things you can do and support you can access to help
you to maintain your independence.

- Plan ahead o On the night before, think about how you plan to spend the day. This can be
  domestic tasks, social activities, appointments, what to eat, etc. It may take you longer to
  complete the tasks than before your diagnosis. This is perfectly fine, so allow enough time to
  not rush.
- Get rest between chores o You might find some
  tasks are harder than others or take up more time
  and energy. It’s important to rest for 30 minutes
  between chores to prevent you from
  feeling fatigued. Make sure this is something
  you find relaxing that doesn’t involve
  physically or mentally pushing yourself. For example, reading a book, watching TV, or
  sleeping for 30 minutes.
- Set achievable goals o Setting unrealistic goals can put you under pressure to complete
  everything in that day. It is okay to finish the task when you feel less tired (whether that’s on
  the same day or another day). It is recommended to start with less demanding tasks and
  increase them throughout the day, if appropriate.
- Consider your cleaning equipment o Use cleaning equipment with long
  handles on mops, brushes, and dust pans. This will help you to avoid bending down or being
  in positions that may be hard to get back up from. An Occupational Therapist (OT) can make
  recommendations tailored to you.
- Adapt your approach o If energy or balance are significant concerns, try sitting down while
  doing tasks such as ironing, washing, and folding to reduce the risk of falls and amount of
  energy used.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“If I’m having people around for dinner, I’ve got to make sure I’ve got a quiet day either
side and I’ve got to plan ahead. So I’ll lay the table a couple of days before and I’ll try and
shop and do a lot of the preparation before I actually have people round.” (Person with
Parkinson’s)
What equipment might help?
Occupational therapists may suggest a rehabilitation approach. They will work with you to learn
how to do things with a different approach. However, they may still suggest equipment.
The world of equipment can be overwhelming, and costly. Some equipment may be paid for by
the NHS or through your local Social Services, but some you will need to buy yourself.
We strongly recommend you speak to an occupational therapist before buying equipment. They
will assess your needs, talk about different strategies and recommend the equipment that is best
for you.
They can then guide you through how to get the equipment if this is needed.
Equipment for Bathing & Showering

- Bath & shower seats can help you get in and out of
  the bath with less risk of falling and to avoid others
  doing heavy lifting if you need help. They reduce
  problems with balance encountered when standing
  in the shower.
- Some bath seats sit across the top of the bath, either
  as a seat or as a simple board, which can be
  removable or on a hinge – note if on a hinge, it can
  be more complex and can be lowered into the bath manually or electrically.
- Seats for shower cubicles can be free standing (stool or chair) or flip-down seat mounted on
  the wall.
- There are many different types: Small, waterproof stools to large, electrically powered seats.
- The seat that is best for you will depend on your shower or bath unit and your own preferences.
- The next step up from these equipment suggestions are more significant
  changes to your bathroom. See the Housing page for information about adaptations.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“When I knew I was having a problem getting out of the bath, I worked it out myself that I
would have to do something in the bathroom. And I spoke to Age UK to get their advice.
And they suggested grab rails. Then came the problem of buying the grab rails and
installing them.
And one of my neighbours volunteered to.” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Equipment for Toileting

- Hand-held urinals are available for both men and women. This can be helpful if you need to urinate
  urgently but can’t get up quickly enough to go.
- Commodes are moveable toilets without running water – like a chair with a container underneath.
  These can be useful if you need the toilet urgently or often, especially at night.
- Discreet disposable pads can go in underwear in case of leakage.

- Some men with urinary incontinence prefer to use a sheath that fits over the penis and collects urine
  in a bag that straps to the leg.
  Raised toilet seats can help you get up more easily from a seated
  position on the toilet.
- Make sure it is large enough for you to sit on comfortably
  and avoid leakage. o Make sure it isn’t too high for other
  people in the house. o Ensure that it can be safely removed
  and replaced.
- Ask for assistance if you’re not able to fix it securely on the
  toilet.
- Grab rails – various types of rails can be installed to help you
  get on and off the toilet. See the Housing page for more details
  on home adaptations.
  Also see the Urinary Symptoms and Bowel Symptoms pages for more tips.
  Bed & mattress equipment
  These makes it easier to get in and out of bed or to reposition in bed. Note ‘grab rails’, fixed to the
  wall, are discussed within adaptations on the Housing page. The height of your bed affects how
  easy it is to push yourself off the bed or to sit down. The ideal height of the bed surface depends
  on how tall you are, but many people find raising the bed or mattress helps.
- Bed raisers raise the whole bed a few inches: o Come in various heights – usually between 3-6 inches
- Come in various materials to match the existing bed legs – wood,
  plastic, or metal o Make sure the bed raisers are stable and well
  supported o The legs of the bed must sit deep within the bed
  raisers, not rest on top of the raisers, or they might slip off o You
  must be able to touch the floor with your feet.
- Mattress
  Variators or Pillow
  Lifters help lift you up into a seated position. They are
  more effective for fairly thin mattresses as thicker
  mattresses are difficult to bend and can scrunch up in
  the middle (less helpful and less comfortable). Mattress
  raisers come in different types:
- Mechanical - can be set to a certain degree of
  elevation, but are more difficult to reposition
- Electric - Allow you to raise and lower the bed
  using a handheld control.
- Pneumatic - Use air to inflate a pillow-like device
  under the mattress to raise and lower it. They can be set to inflate only on one side,
  turning you at the same time.
- Choosing and using a mattress raiser:
- Check that the controls are easy to use - Single button controls might be simplest
- Check how noisy the device is.
- Make sure electric cords, feeding lines or bedding won’t get caught up when the
  raiser is in motion.
- Be aware that in the raised position, a mattress raiser can cause you to slide down
  and out of the bed.
- Bed levers or bed rails fix to the bed and have a metal
  handle that extends up the side of the mattress.
- You shouldn't use a bed lever with an air mattress.
- They do require moderate upper body strength to
  use, and it is best be training by a professional to
  use them.
- Caution using a bed lever with an adjustable bed or
  mattress raiser – special consideration is required to
  ensure it is secure. It is best to get professional advice
  for this.
  Beds
- Electric profiling or hospital beds allow you to control your position within the bed: usually
  allowing you to control an up & down movement of both the head end of the bed and a
  bend at the knees.
- They can be used to help you sit up from lying down and can help you manage symptoms
  or dizziness or ankle swelling.
- Hospital beds are usually height-adjustable and may have side rails. They may have casters
  or wheels, which allow the bed to be moved. These can be provided by health professional
  such as your district nurse if needed.
- Electric profiling beds tend to look more like an ordinary bed. Some double bed styles are
  available that split the mattress so each person can adjust the mattress to the position they
  want. They can raise up and down and some can raise your upper body and provide a knee
  break (see image).
- Comfort and safety tips:
- Make sure electric cords, feeding lines or bedding won’t be caught up when the
  mattress is being raised.
- Take extra care if the bed has heavy sides that go up and down, as it may be easy for
  your fingers or hands to get caught (especially if the rail comes down suddenly).
- Make sure the controls can be reached easily when lying down.
  Hoists
- These equipment lift a person between a bed and a (wheel) chair, or a bed and a commode,
  and back.
- There are several types available, e.g.
  oMobile
  oCeiling fixed o Full body o
  Standing hoist
- You will need the correct one for you and your
  home as well as training to use it. It is not
  recommended that you buy a hoist on your own;
  you should first talk with an occupational
  therapist.
  Living S pace E quipment
- It is much harder to get out of furniture that is low and soft.
- Special raisers for chairs that can make it easier to stand up
  from.
- A ‘lift cushion’ is a portable cushion that can be used on most
  chairs and sofas.
- Electric lift chairs can be helpful if you have difficulty getting out of a chair
  as they provide support when going from sitting to standing.
  Cutlery
- Several specialty designs are available:
- All-in-one knife and fork. o All-in-one fork and spoon.
- Special handles that are extra-large, easy-grip, extra-light (moulded
  rubber), weighted or curved.
- Foam sleeves, which can be placed over existing cutlery to make
  them easier to hold. o Cutlery which can be bent to suit different
  grips.
- If your movements are slow and stiff, extra-large or curved-handled
  cutlery may work best for you.
- If you have a tremor, a combined fork and
  spoon, a heaver item, or a utensil with moulded
  rubber handles may work best for
  you.
- Special food preparation
  knives are available: Curved-
  handled or rocking action knife
  can be used for chopping food. The handle is
  D or L-shaped to give you more control and usually made of easy-grip
  material. They come in a variety of sizes.
- These are often available in high street mobility shops or online. See
  our advice about buying equipment before you make a purchase.
  Equipment for Plates & Bowls
- Plate guards clip onto the plate and provide an upright ring around it.
- It stops food from falling off the edge of your plate, and can be used to push the food
  back onto your fork or spoon by pressing the utensil and food against it. o They come in
  various sizes, colours and materials. Some people prefer styles made
  of sturdy materials that are easier to wash. o Note some are
  positioned about an inch in from the outer edge of plate, which can
  decrease the usable area of the plate.
- Non-slip food mats are made of a special tacky silicone or plastic
  material, which you put under a plate or bowl to stop it from
  moving around while you eat.
- They can be especially helpful if you have limited mobility in Image:
  one arm and find yourself chasing your plate across the table. Completecareshop.co.uk
- They can also be used on trays to stop cups from sliding; or between a mixing bowl and
  work surface to stop the bowl from moving around
- Come in range of colours – you can buy them pre-cut as a placemat, or
  you can buy the material and cut to the size you need.
  Cups
  As well as usual off-the-shelf lidded cups, there are other specialised
  designs that can make drinking easier.
- Nosey cups have a section cut out on one side, opposite the position of
  the mouth when drinking. The cut-out allows the person drinking to tilt
  and drain the cup more easily with limited neck movement.
- All of these cups come in different sizes, shapes, and colours and may
  have handles – consider what you will use it for, so that it is fit-for-
  purpose (e.g. an appropriate material for hot drinks).
  Hot water devices
- ‘Kettle tippers’ are designed to cradle your kettle. This allows
  you to pour boiling water out of the kettle without lifting it up.
- They can reduce risk of spills and burns.
- They can be used on different common teapot or
  kettle styles.
- Check it works with your kettle before buying.
- Boiling water dispensers provide boiling water without a
  kettle or saucepan. o You fill them manually, with a certain Image: I OM l iving solutions
  amount, then they dispense a specified amount of boiling
  water.
- Fairly easy to use.
- They enable only the amount of water needed to be boiled.
  Home Access
- Key turner: A key turner is a handle that attaches to your keys
  and provides easier grip and leverage for turning keys.
- Key safe: This is a small secure box, fitted to a wall outside the
  front door to hold the keys to your home. It requires a code to
  access: you choose whom to give the code to. This can be very
  useful as multiple sets of keys do not need to be provided to
  family members or healthcare professionals. It will also allow
  people to access the house in case of an emergency.
  Alarms and Security
- There is a wide range of systems available to either attract attention or contact someone in case
  of emergency.
- Basic alarms: can be worn (e.g. on your wrist or as a pendant) or placed in the
  home. When you press the alarm, they can either make a loud noise to send a signal to
  someone.
- Security systems, for example:
- Devices to track your location so someone could find you if needed.
- Sensors that detect if you fall over.
- More information about these systems is available on the NHS website and the Which? Later
  Life Care website.
- If falls are a concern, please also see the Balance and Falls page.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“We have a flat mat that you put on the floor. An alarm goes off. If you put it on the floor
by the side of the bed, and as soon as you step on it, an alarm goes off. Very loudly.” (Person
with Parkinson’s)
Advice on buying equipment
Standard equipment and smaller adaptations (for example, an additional stair rail or raised toilet
seat) recommended by an occupational therapist are often provided free of charge. Some
equipment does come with a charge. An Occupational Therapist can assess your needs and advise
further.
However, if you are buying your own equipment, here are a few tips:

1. Be informed: The Disabled Living Foundation has a range of fact sheets offering a range of general
   advice regarding features to look for when considering equipment.
2. Consider how and where you will use the equipment and the impact on others who use the space.
3. Try the equipment before you buy it.

- To find your nearest equipment demonstration centre, check the Disabled Living Foundation’s
  website, www.livingmadeeasy.org.uk.You can search “equipment centre” for a list of equipment
  centres.
- If possible, try out the different types to see which kind you find helpful.
- The same website offers guidance on suppliers and allows you to compare products. You can
  search “askSARA” on their website for more information.

4. Make sure the fit of the equipment is correct.
5. Local pharmacies and disability shops sell equipment. Short term hire can be possible from local
   organisations, such as Red Cross Society.
   Who can help?
   If daily tasks are particularly challenging, some people need assistance from a person. The degree
   of assistance will vary, and as much independence as possible should still be encouraged. There
   are two main categories to consider discussed here. There is also information on the Guidance
   for Family & Carers page for people who are supporting someone they know.
   Home Help
   ‘Home Help’ refers to support for domestic tasks such as laundry, washing up and cleaning. Local
   councils do not usually provide this. Many charities offer these services, though there may be a
   charge.
   For example:

- Royal Voluntary Service
- The British Red Cross
- Age UK
  Details for all of these and for more information about Home Help can be found at the end of this
  section in the More Information section.
  Home C are
  ‘Home Care’ refers to support for personal tasks
  such as showering, dressing and preparing
  meals. If you think you might benefit from paid
  Home Care:

1. The first step is to get a Needs
   Assessment.
   Contact your Local Council Adult Social Care
   Department for this. They will make an
   assessment to see if Home Care is
   recommended.

- If it is not recommended but you want it, you
  could arrange it privately. The Adult Social Care Department should still support
  you with this, for example giving information about local providers.

2. If Home Care is recommended then they will complete a financial assessment. This determines
   whether or not the council will financially contribute to your Home Care costs.

- The Finances page has more information about benefits you may be eligible for to help
  with costs.

3. You then need to arrange the Home Care.

- If the council are paying, they can arrange the Home Care for you.
- If the council are paying, you can still choose to arrange the Home Care yourself. For
  this ask to receive your ‘personal budget’ as a direct payment.
- If the council will not contribute financially, you will need to find and pay for it yourself.
- The council should be able to support you with finding care, whichever category you
  are in.
  There are broadly two options for finding Home Care:
  a. Go through a Home Care Agency. Agencies arrange for trained carers to visit you in your
  home, but it may not always be the same carer. The agency olds responsibility as the
  employer of the carer. They are registered with the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
  Or
  b. Directly employ a Home Care Worker yourself. This way you know who you are getting,
  but you have legal responsibility as an employer and need to plan for the carer’s holiday
  and sickness. Note this responsibility is yours if you directly employ the carer, even if you
  receive financial support from the council. Individual carers do not have to be registered
  with a regulatory body.
  Finding a Home Care Agency

1. First find out what is available in your area. Suggested resources:

- NHS website
- Your local council
- United Kingdom Homecare Association (UKHCA)
- Which? Later Life Care – online Care Services Directory
- Is there anyone in your area who you trust who has experience? Can they make a

recommendation? 2. Get more information about them:

- Agencies are registered and reviewed by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) so consider reading
  the report.
- Could you ask someone with experience of that agency for an informal review?

- Contact the provider to ask more about their service.
  Directly employing a Home Care Worker

1. Find out what is available in your area. Suggested resources:

- NHS website
- Your local council
- Search online
- Is there anyone in your area who you trust who has experience? Can
  they make a recommendation?
- You could use a Broker or Introductory Care Agency. These help you find the Home Care
  Worker, but you still directly employ them. Note these agencies are not registered with
  the CQC.

2. Approach them and get more information about them:

- Write a job description to be clear what is required.
- Ask for references.
- Meet them in person.
- Write a contract and get it checked.
- Ensure you follow all of the requirements of an employer (see Legal Matters).
- For more guidance see the Which? Later Life Care website.
  For both - things to ask about:
- Cost: What is the cost? What services incur an extra cost? Does the time of the shift affect
  the cost (e.g. evenings, weekends, bank holidays)?
- Experience: Do the care workers have experience in supporting someone with similar
  needs to you? For an agency: How do they allocate the care workers to ensure suitable?
- Training: What training have the care workers had?
- Timing: Will the care worker visit at a specified time? What is the procedure if they are
  running late?
- Contract: Can you review a standard contract?
- Contact: How can the agency or Care Worker be contacted, including for emergencies
  outside office hours?
- For directly employing an individual:
- How would you pay them – method and how often? o What
  happens if they are ill or unable to attend for any other reason? o
  Could anyone cover for their holiday?
  Where can I get help?
- National Health Service (NHS) - outpatient and community therapy teams,
  including
  Occupational Therapists. Referral pathways vary by area. In most places your GP will be able
  to refer to occupational therapy. Adult Social care: Some occupational therapists work
  within Adult Social Care services. Other social care professionals, such as social workers,
  can also help you with advice and equipment. You can find contact details for your social
  services on your council website or can ask at your GP.Voluntary sector: Charities and third
  sector organisations may be able to help. They can offer some support and some have
  short term equipment hire services.
- Private sector: Local pharmacies and disability shops are common
  on the high street. You can also find a wide range of providers online.
  For more details see the Services & Groups page.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“As an OT, we might assess somebody shopping, cooking, cleaning, to see how they
manage washing, transfers in and out of the bath, up and down steps. To see where the
difficulty lies and what we could then try to do to lessen that difficulty. And also, we
encourage graded activity, somebody who isn’t doing much to gradually get back into
doing more.” (Occupational Therapist)

  Finances
  Introduction
  Having Parkinson’s, or caring for someone who does, can
  impact on your finances. For example, you may need to
  reduce your hours at work or pay for cleaners or special
  equipment in the home. Managing financially may
  become more difficult as the condition progresses.
  There is some help available so it can help to know what
  you might be entitled to.
  Paying bills and budgeting
  Some symptoms of Parkinson’s may affect how you manage your money. They might include:

* Difficulties signing documents due to, for example, tremor
* Mobility problems may prevent you being able to go to the bank or cashpoint
* Speech problems may make paying by phone challenging
* Memory and thinking problems may make it difficult to do calculations or planning for
  payments
