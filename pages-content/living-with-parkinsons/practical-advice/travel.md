# The decision

The DVLA will typically inform you of one of four decisions:

1) **Your current license will remain without any restrictions**  
You can continue to drive as you have done before without any expiry date, review, or adaptations needed. However, if symptoms change or get worse you will need to let the DVLA know.

2) **A new short-term medical driving license is issued**  
You can continue to drive as you have done before but the decision will be reviewed again by the DVLA when the short-term license expires. The DVLA offer 1, 2, 3, or 5 year short-term medical licenses.

3) **Your licence is restricted to vehicles with specific adaptations**  
If you are required to adapt your car as part of the DVLA decision, you can visit a mobility centre for an independent assessment and equipment.

4) **Your licence is no longer valid and you cannot legally drive**  
If the DVLA’s decision is that you can no longer drive, they will give you an overview of how they came to that decision, and the reason why. They will also tell you if you can reapply for a reassessment in the future. Any fees linked with the application process will be refunded.

---

However, if you do not agree with the decision because the information provided was not understood correctly or you feel it is not a true reflection of your condition, you have a right to appeal. The DVLA decision letter will outline the details of who you can contact. You will need to give the reasons why you feel the original decision was wrong.

You may need to have a new medical examination or driving assessment in order for the DVLA to reconsider their decision. If you do not agree with their second decision you have a right to appeal to the magistrates’ court. This appeal must be made within 6 months from when the license was taken away or refused. You must inform the DVLA that you will be appealing to the court. For more information please read the Legal Matters document.

---

# Summary of the decision making process

1. Inform DVLA of your health condition.  
2. Discuss with your Parkinson’s specialist or GP if you can continue to drive while waiting for DVLA’s decision.  
3. Wait for DVLA’s decision (this typically happens within six weeks). You may be asked to have a medical or driving assessment.  
4. You receive DVLA’s decision:  
   - If they decide **YES**: you can continue to drive under the conditions they outline in the decision letter.  
   - If they decide **NO**: you can appeal for a reassessment, appeal to local magistrates court within six months, or stop driving.

# What can I try for myself?

As already stated, you must inform DVLA of your medical condition. These are some suggestions for maintaining your safety as a driver:

1. Talk with your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP about how your medications may affect driving. If you feel very sleepy in the daytime you can discuss options of different medications or dosages.  
2. Book yourself for regular sight and hearing tests. Make sure you have any aids that would help you when driving.  
3. Avoid distractions – Parkinson’s can affect your ability to do several things at once; it is important that you keep your attention on the road.  
4. Look into options of cars with adaptations that may make driving easier. These might be steering aids or hand controls. You can visit a mobility centre for advice.  
5. Driving can be stressful and stress worsens symptoms of Parkinson’s. Try to reduce this stress by planning your route in advance and allowing yourself plenty of time.

# Parking

As Parkinson’s can affect your walking this section aims to provide you with helpful information and options. These will help make it possible to park closer to the services and places that you are visiting.

---

## What can I do?

### The Blue Badge Scheme

The Blue Badge Scheme aims to help people with mobility issues (as either the driver or passenger of a car) to park closer to their destination. The blue badge is linked to the individual rather than a vehicle and so can be used in any car you are travelling in. This includes hire cars or taxis.

The key benefits to getting a Blue Badge is that it lets you park for free:

- In designated disabled parking bays on streets for as long as needed, unless the sign posting indicates a time limit.  
- On streets with parking meters or pay and display for as long as needed, unless the sign posting indicates a time limit.  
- On single or double yellow lines for up to 3 hours.  
- Can be exempt from the congestion charge in Central London – there is an administration fee.

---

These benefits and parking rules apply to most of the UK but not everywhere in the UK. Examples of where there are different schemes include some airports, e.g. Heathrow Airport, and some central London boroughs, e.g. City of Westminster. The Government website GOV.UK has more information. Please check with local boroughs guidelines for parking schemes.

It is also important to know that the Blue Badge is for street parking. You will need to check the signs for private parking to see if you still have to pay. Such places would be parking in hospitals or supermarkets. You will still have to follow all other standard parking regulations.

---

## Who is entitled to a blue badge?

Some individuals can receive automatic qualification whilst other people may have to qualify through an assessment.

See extra information below about current eligibility criteria for automatic qualification.

## Eligibility for Blue Badge

You may automatically qualify for a Blue Badge if you meet **any one** of the following:

- In receipt of the higher rate of the mobility component within the Disability Living Allowance  
- In receipt of a Personal Independence Payment because you cannot walk more than 500 metres (score of 8 points or less for the “moving around” activity)  
- In receipt of the mobility component of the Personal Independence Payment and obtain 10 points for the “planning and following journeys” activity  
- Receiving the War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement  
- Been certified as having a permanent and substantial disability which impacts your ability to walk and have received a lump sum benefit within the tariff levels 1-8 of the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme  

See the extra information section about what might make you eligible for assessment for the Blue Badge Scheme.

---

If one or more of the following situations applies, you **might** be asked to do a mobility assessment. This is where a health professional assesses your mobility and advises the council on whether you need a Blue Badge:

- Unable to walk  
- Experience difficulty walking due to pain, breathlessness, or need support from someone/mobility aids  
- Be at serious risk to yourself or others when walking  

If your condition improves and you no longer need the Blue Badge, you must return the badge to the council or you could be fined.

---

## How do I apply for a Blue Badge?

You can apply for your Blue Badge on the [gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge) website, which will direct you to your local council site to apply online. Someone else can apply on your behalf, but they will need access to your supporting documents (e.g., proof of identity, proof of address, a passport-sized photo, and supporting evidence).

You will usually need to provide supporting evidence of your medical condition, such as:  
- A letter from your specialist  
- A summary of your health conditions from your GP  
- A letter from a social worker  

Your council website will tell you exactly what you need to provide. Some councils offer telephone helplines or postal applications. Please check with your local council. There is usually a small fee for the Blue Badge.

The badge typically lasts up to 3 years before you need to renew. You must apply for renewal before the old one expires. Councils usually aim to make a decision within 12 weeks.

### What Can I Try for Myself?
1. Check eligibility for each scheme and apply for those that suit your needs.  
2. Plan trips carefully as some transport options need advance booking.  
3. Applying for multiple schemes increases your transport options (e.g., use Taxicard if Dial-a-Ride isn’t available).

---

### My Experience
> “…the chance to meet with a colleague's neighbour who had Parkinson's for some time. Seeing him still enjoying life—driving, working, travelling—was a big step to helping me get back on my feet after the diagnosis.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*

---

## Finding Toilets When Out and About

Parkinson’s may make accessing toilets more difficult due to mobility or bladder symptoms.

### National Key Scheme
- Allows people with disabilities to unlock over 9,000 accessible public toilets across the UK.  
- The key is called a **Radar Key** and can be purchased via the Disability Rights UK website.  
- The website also provides a regional list of participating toilets.  
- The **Urinary Symptoms** pages may also be helpful for additional support.

---

## Flying and Travelling Abroad

- Parkinson’s should not stop you from planning holidays or flying abroad.  
- With good planning and consideration of extra needs, many people with Parkinson’s continue to enjoy travel and breaks.  
- Taking extra steps in preparation can reduce travel worries and make the experience smoother.

### Am I Safe to Travel?

- **Consult your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team before traveling.** They can advise on managing your medication while away, especially if crossing time zones.
- **Take an extra week’s supply of medication** in your carry-on luggage to avoid issues if baggage is lost or delayed.
- **Keep medicines and medical equipment in original, clearly labelled packaging.**
- **Carry a medical letter or summary** from your GP or specialist outlining your condition and medication, which can be useful if you feel unwell abroad or are stopped at security/customs.
- Inform the travel company of your condition **at least 48 hours before your trip** to arrange any support you might need.

---

### Can I Fly?

- Parkinson’s does **not** prevent you from flying.
- Flying may be more challenging due to symptoms like stiffness, walking difficulties, anxiety, or sleep issues.
- Stay hydrated during the flight to reduce symptoms.
- Consider booking seats with extra legroom or near the front of the plane.
- It is illegal in the UK and Europe for airlines to refuse boarding due to disability.

---

### Going Abroad

- Plan for possible medical needs while on holiday.
- Check country-specific travel advice on the gov.uk website under “foreign travel advice” or contact the embassy of your destination.
- Get any necessary vaccines at least 8 weeks before travel.
- The **Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)** has replaced the EHIC for subsidised healthcare in the EU; still, travel insurance is essential.
- Be aware of local healthcare options and insurance coverage.

---

### Practical Tips for Travel

1. Talk with your GP about travel plans, medication management, and obtaining a medical letter.
2. Carry medication and equipment in labelled packages.
3. Bring extra medication in carry-on baggage.
4. Inform your travel provider about Parkinson’s before your trip.
5. Stay well hydrated.
6. Apply for your Global Health Insurance Card.
7. Seek medical help promptly if you feel unwell abroad.

---

### Real Experience

> “I take sealed bottles of spare medication on any trip abroad — one in hand luggage and one in hold luggage. If something happens to either, I still have my medication. If nothing happens, I have extra which is handy for delays like volcanic ash or pandemics halting air travel.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*
