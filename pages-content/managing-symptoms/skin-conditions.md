# Skin Conditions

## Introduction
People with Parkinson’s can experience a variety of skin issues, including:  
- **Oily skin**  
- **Seborrhoeic dermatitis**: red, itchy, sore skin that may flake, peel, or develop thick crusts/scales  
- **Wounds or ulcers** from delayed healing or pressure  
- **Abnormal moles**

## What Might Be Causing It?

### Oily Skin
- Skin produces **sebum**, which keeps it supple.  
- People with Parkinson’s may produce more sebum, causing the face and scalp to appear shiny and oily.  

### Seborrhoeic Dermatitis
- Cause is not fully understood, but a type of yeast on the skin may play a role.  
- Not caused by poor hygiene.  
- More common in men, possibly due to male hormones increasing sebum production.  

### Wounds & Ulcers
- **Peripheral neuropathy** may reduce sensation in extremities.  
- Injuries or infections may go unnoticed and heal more slowly with age, poor nutrition, or other health conditions.  
- Prolonged pressure on a body area increases risk of pressure ulcers.  

### Abnormal Moles & Parkinson’s
- Slightly higher risk of abnormal moles or melanoma in people with Parkinson’s.  
- Melanoma is linked to UV light exposure.  
- About 16,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each year ([NHS Melanoma Info](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer)).  

> Note: All of these skin issues also occur in people without Parkinson’s.

## What Should I Do About It?
See your **GP promptly** if:  
- A wound isn’t healing properly.  
- A crusted, rough, raised spot or rash isn’t healing or is enlarging.  
- A mole is concerning or has changed:  
  - Size ≥ 5mm, irregular edges, multi-coloured, lop-sided/asymmetric, or changing.  

Routine GP visits are appropriate for other skin conditions that are bothering you.

## What Can I Try for Myself?

### Seborrhoeic Dermatitis
- Wash hair/beard with **ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulphide, or coal tar shampoo**.  
- For crusts or scales:  
  - Rub olive or mineral oil a few hours before washing.  
  - Use a de-scaling agent (ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulphide, coal tar).  
- Regular use of **tea tree oil shampoos** may help.  
- Clean eyelids daily with cotton buds and baby shampoo.  
- Avoid irritants on face and body.  

### Oily Skin
- Wash face with mild soap twice daily in warm water; rinse in cool water.  
- Use water-based gels instead of oil-based creams.  
- Avoid products containing alcohol or that irritate skin.  
- Seek advice from a pharmacist or GP for suitable products.  

### Wounds & Ulcers
- Keep skin clean and dry, especially in folds and between toes.  
- Regularly check for wounds, especially in areas with reduced sensation.  
- Signs of poor healing: pain, bad smell, fluid leakage, swelling, enlarging wounds.  
- Change position regularly to prevent pressure ulcers.  

### Abnormal Moles
- Check moles monthly; photograph or ask someone to help with hard-to-see areas.  
- Be vigilant if you have:  
  - High sun exposure or sunburn history  
  - Many moles/freckles  
  - Skin that doesn’t tan easily  
  - Red/blonde hair or blue eyes  
  - Close relatives with melanoma  
- Look for: size >5mm, irregular edges, multi-coloured, asymmetric, changing.  
- Protect skin from sun:  
  - Use clothing, shade, and sunscreen (SPF ≥ 30, liberal and repeated application).  
  - Avoid peak sun hours (11am–3pm, Mar–Oct in the UK).  
  - Even on cloudy or cool days, UV exposure is possible.  
  - Sunlight through windows does not produce enough Vitamin D.  
  - October–March sunlight in the UK is insufficient for Vitamin D synthesis.  
- See the **Eating Well** page for dietary Vitamin D sources.  
- There is no safe way to get a tan from sunlight.

## Further Assessment
Healthcare professionals may ask about:  
- Onset and duration of the skin condition.  
- Location and spread.  
- Any pain, itch, or discharge.  
- Recent changes in medications.  
- Sun exposure history.  
- Family history of skin cancer.  

> A GP or specialist can determine whether further tests, treatments, or referrals are needed.

## Questions Your Healthcare Professional May Ask
- What the skin problem is (rash, wound, mole, oily skin, etc.).  
- When it first occurred and how it has changed over time.  
- Whether you have experienced it before.  
- What you have already tried to manage it.  
- Location and extent of the problem.  
- Any associated symptoms (pain, itch, discharge, bleeding).  

> It can be helpful to record these answers in your **“My Health”** section before your appointment.

## Track Your Symptoms
- Use the **Symptom and Activity Tracker** to record:  
  - When you notice a skin issue.  
  - Details of its appearance (size, colour, texture, location).  
  - Changes over time (check again a few weeks later).  
- This helps healthcare professionals identify patterns and monitor changes.

---

## Tests
- Some skin conditions may require further testing:  
  - **Biopsy:** a small sample of skin or mole is examined under a microscope.  
  - Additional tests may be ordered depending on the suspected cause or severity.  

---

## Further Treatments

### Medication
- **Seborrhoeic dermatitis:**  
  - Face, body, scalp: ketoconazole cream, mild steroid cream, or combined anti-fungal/steroid creams (short-term use only).  
  - Hair (head or beard): ketoconazole shampoo, selenium sulphide shampoo.  
- **Wounds:** if infected, antibiotics may be required.  

> Do not change medications without consulting your healthcare professional.

### Referral
- **Suspected skin cancer:** referral to a **dermatologist** (usually within a couple of weeks).  
- **Severe or uncontrolled seborrhoeic dermatitis:** may require dermatologist assessment.  
- **Long-term wounds:** may require ongoing review by a GP practice nurse or district nursing service.

## Key Messages
- People with Parkinson’s can experience skin conditions that are also common in the general population.  
- Skin issues more common in Parkinson’s include:  
  - Oily skin  
  - Seborrhoeic dermatitis  
  - Wounds and ulcers  
  - Abnormal moles  
- If you have reduced sensation in any area, **check the skin regularly** for cuts, wounds, or changes that are slow to heal (e.g., every time you bathe).
