# Living with Parkinson's

## Taking Medication

- In general, once medications are started for Parkinson's, some form of medication will continue. The schedule, dose, and type of medication may change, but they are generally taken for life
- For some, this will be a major life adjustment, for others it is a familiar habit.
- Think about how you can build taking medication into your daily life, and of ways to remember but that are not disruptive.
- Find out how your GP runs repeat prescriptions to make sure you always have enough medicine.

## Exercise

- Exercise is true for general health and wellbeing, but is especially important in Parkinson's. Research has shown immediate benefits, such as relieving muscle tension and lifting mood. It has also shown the long-term benefits, such as reduction in many Parkinson's symptoms.

## Find Support

- Find out where you can get support. You are not alone. Establishing a support network ranges from knowing who your Parkinson's specialist team are, to knowing who will listen when you need a moan. Some people find support groups helpful. Others look for connections online, in exercise classes, or through other friends.

## What do I need to do?

- If you are a driver, you are legally obliged to inform the DVLA of your diagnosis. This does not mean you have to stop driving, unless your doctor tells you to stop. See the Travel section for more guidance.

## Information

- There is a lot of information available about Parkinson's.
- Information can be empowering but running a google search could be overwhelming. You will find things that are not relevant to you and may find some things upsetting.
- Perhaps start with our What is Parkinson's page and take it slowly.
- Everyone is different. When reading information, be aware that someone else's experience of Parkinson's will be different to yours.
- There is more guidance on using information resources on our Further Support page. If you do want to explore more, consider reading this first.

## Talking to Others

Except for the legal requirement above, only you can decide who you tell about your diagnosis, and when. There is no rush, but you might find relief in sharing this news.

If you do tell others, bear in mind that they will have a reaction too. That reaction is a reflection of them processing the information. It does not change your condition.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson's describe their experiences.

> "Be gentle with yourself. In the following few weeks - perhaps not straight away - you may well be knocked off your feet by waves of anxiety and panic; this is normal, and it will ease. It'll be the shock and not the Parkinson's - you won't feel like this forever. Hang on in there."

> "I personally think you should try to exercise as much as possible, you should try different sorts of exercise, on top of cardio, things that work on your balance and coordination for example. I am convinced it is thanks to exercising that I'm still working full time and doing everything I want to do almost five years after diagnosis." (Person with Parkinson's)

> "I chose to tell everyone, and this led to me having the chance to meet with a colleague's neighbour who had had Parkinson's for some time. Seeing him still enjoying life - driving, working, travelling - was a big step to helping me get back on my feet after the diagnosis." (Person with Parkinson's)

> "I was resigned, not phased and not curious… I opted for talking to those with Parkinson's." (Person with Parkinson's)

> "Whatever picture you have in your head of someone with Parkinson's - perhaps through personal experience, perhaps through images on the media - this is not a preview of your destiny. Parkinson's affects different people in very different ways."

> "For me, taking part in research projects has been a big factor in coming to terms with the diagnosis. It's heartening to know that there are so many skilled scientists beavering away towards a cure and I've found that joining forces with these researchers has been a really positive experience. Your neurologist may be able to suggest projects in which you can get involved but you could also look at the Cure Parkinson's Trust site (cureparkinsons.org.uk) or the research section of the Parkinson's UK site. (parkinsons.org.uk/research)."

> "There are inspirational people (Tom Isaacs, Michael J Fox, Emma Lawton for starters.)… three of the 'Tips for the Newly Diagnosed' which I came across recently on the Twitter feed of the wonderfully named @DancingShrub - a nurse with Parkinson's. He says "you are still you, degenerative isn't next week and you are not alone."

If you have any tips please tell a member of the study team or email rf.livewellparkinsons@nhs.net

## Optimising Wellbeing

Every day you make choices that impact on your health and well-being: from what you do, to what you eat, to whom you see. This section gives guidance on things you can do to help you live well with Parkinson's.

The advice to keep active, eat well and stay social is, of course, applicable to everyone. The guidance in this section is intended to help you continue to lead a full life after your Parkinson's diagnosis, with any challenges it presents. We also want to highlight the current research showing the extent to which exercise can improve mobility and overall quality of life in people with Parkinson's.

## Making Changes & Keeping on Track

Although everyone's condition and circumstances are different, everyone has ups and downs. This can make it hard to 'follow a plan'. There are different ways to approach this difficulty.

### Tips to consider:

1. **Think about what is important to you**: Focus on things that are important to you to keep you motivated.
2. **Break it down**: If a task or ambition feels big, break it down into a series of smaller steps.
3. **Set a realistic target or aim**: This is like making a New Year resolution. It should be specific and something you can achieve, so that you feel encouraged when you meet it.
4. **Work with your body**: Try to use the good times and don't be too hard on yourself during the difficult times. If symptoms are getting in the way, read the symptom pages for tips on managing them.
5. **Record progress**: Some people find it helpful to keep a log of what they are doing.

- You could add your planned actions in a To Do List and check it off when completed.
