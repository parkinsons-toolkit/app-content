There are several legal arrangements that everyone should consider at some stage in their lives. It helps to put these in place as soon as possible. This may involve insurance, power of attorney, decisions about how they wish to be treated and making a will. This section will discuss these legal aspects in some detail. For information about employment please see the section <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/work-and-caring" class="internal-link">Work & Caring</a>.

## Insurance

Many of us have some type of insurance whether that be house or home insurance or policies covering car, travel or funeral plans. You will need to inform some of your insurance companies if diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.

### What should I do?

There are several steps for you to go through once you have received a diagnosis of Parkinson’s:

1. Contact relevant insurance companies (e.g., life, critical illness, driving and travel insurances), as having Parkinson’s can affect your policies. Your insurance may be invalid if you do not tell them.
2. It may help to offer or to provide a relevant medical report. This allows the insurance company to have a better understanding of your situation. Your GP or specialist will be able to provide this report.
3. Someone from the insurance company may want to talk with you. This may be to decide at what cost they are willing to provide insurance, or they may want you to change your policy or cancel it. You can contact Citizen’s Advice if you need help with insurance and legal matters. The Discrimination section below may be helpful if you feel that you are not being treated fairly by your insurance company due to your diagnosis of Parkinson’s.

## Powers of Attorney

If you want someone else to make either health or financial decisions on your behalf, you can arrange for something called Power of attorney. This can be arranged on a short-term basis or as part of your longer-term plans and is something that we should all consider. In the future, there may be a time where you lose the ability to make decisions for yourself, which we refer to as decision making capacity.

This may be because you:

- can’t understand what is being asked,
- weigh up benefits or risks,
- retain information given to you,
- communicate your decision to others.

Power of attorney provides someone that you trust with the legal power to make decisions in your best interests. However, a power of attorney can only be arranged when you have the ability and understanding to do so, that is you are assessed as having mental capacity. Therefore, it is important to decide as early as possible whether you want to have someone acting on your behalf, in your best interests in the future and if so, who that person or people would be.

This section will outline the different types of power of attorney and other common questions surrounding powers of attorney. The information relates to England and Wales (Mental Capacity Act 2005).

### Types of Power of Attorney

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/lady-on-computer.jpg" alt="computer" class="legal-matters__lady-on-computer">

- **Ordinary Power of Attorney** is for financial decisions only and is only valid if this is drawn up while you still have ability to make decisions. For example: Someone may still be able to manage their money. However, they would prefer a trusted person to make a decision if they were planning to be out of the country for some time – for example. Jane, for instance, is going back to Jamaica for a long holiday, she appoints her niece Donna to deal with a specific matter concerning her house sale while she is away. A solicitor will help with drawing up such a document giving Donna the power to sign relevant legal papers while her aunt is away.
- **Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)** There are two separate types of lasting power of attorney (health and welfare AND property and affairs). You can choose to apply for just one or both.
  - <ins>Health and welfare:</ins> Once registered, the health and welfare LPA can be used by the person or people you have chosen if you can no longer make decisions for yourself. This is known as losing mental capacity. Health and welfare decisions could include deciding where you should live, medical treatment, and your day to day care.
  - <ins>Finance and affairs:</ins> Once registered, the finance LPA will automatically be valid. Therefore, the person you trust can make financial decisions both now and in the future. This can be at a time when you may or may not be able to make decisions yourself. Financial decisions could include paying bills, paying the mortgage, buying and selling property.
- **Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)**
  - Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) was used before lasting power of attorney replaced it in October 2007. EPA cover finances. If you signed an EPA before 1st October 2007 then it should still be valid, but you may want to make a LPA to reflect other decisions.

### When should I consider this?

Lasting power of attorney is a decision that everyone should consider as they get older as soon as possible. You may decide that you do not want a power of attorney. You will need to choose a specific person or people whom you trust to be your power of attorney (e.g. partner, child, friend). Either way it is important to put your wishes in place as soon as possible.

Over time, your preferences may change or the person you choose may not be available and so you might want to make a new document. For example, you may change your mind as to whom you want registered as having power of attorney or you may have chosen one type of LPA and want to extend it.

### What should I do?

If you decide you would like to appoint someone to have lasting power of attorney for you, there are a number of steps to take:

1. You should make sure the person/people you would like to appoint is/are happy to take on the responsibility. It is also important to clearly outline your expectations with that person or people.
2. You can contact the Office of the Public Guardian (0300 456 0300) for Lasting Power of Attorney forms and information pack. The forms can also be printed or completed online. Go to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK website</a> and type “lasting power of attorney” in the search bar.
3. The ‘health and welfare’ and ‘finance and affairs’ powers of attorney are two separate documents. Therefore, they require two separate applications should you want both.
4. You can complete these forms without a lawyer. However, getting professional help may reduce potential mistakes and prevent problems later. You can seek information from the <a href="https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizens Advice</a> or <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/office-of-the-public-guardian" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Office of the Public Guardian</a> directly.
5. An impartial professional (for example, a doctor, solicitor or social worker) must sign the document. This is to confirm that you have not been forced into signing the power of attorney under pressure. This person is known as a “certificate provider”.
6. The completed document must be sent to the Office of the Public Guardian to be registered. There is a registration fee. However, this can be reduced depending on your income.
7. The registration and decision process can take 8-9 weeks. During this time the power of attorney cannot be used.
8. You may be unsure if your power of attorney is registered. If so, you can contact the Office of the Public Guardian to ask (0300 456 0300).

You will be assessed to see if you have capacity to make this decision. This assessment will be by an impartial professional and the Office of the Public Guardian. If they believe you do not have capacity, then you have a couple of options:

1. Reapply at another time when you may be deemed to have capacity;
2. Someone can apply for something called deputyship from the Court of Protection.

Deputyship is a similar role to someone who is an attorney. Similar to lasting power of attorney there are two types, property and affairs, and personal welfare. Deputyship can be applied when someone lacks the ability to make their own decisions. However, there are far more processes to applying for deputyship than arranging a lasting power of attorney:

1. Becoming a deputy costs more money.
2. Deputyship requires an annual deputyship report to be sent to the Court of Protection. This is to make sure the person acting as deputy is acting in your best interests. This may offer a sense of protection for some.

### What if I do not want to make a lasting power of attorney?

It is important to understand that it is your decision. You should not feel pressured by anyone into something you do not feel comfortable with. You may decide you do not want to appoint someone to have power of attorney. However, it is worth understanding some of the reasons why it might be useful:

- Being married or in a civil partnership does not mean your partner can make financial or health decisions on your behalf.
- If you lose ability to make decisions without an LPA in place, then the Court of Protection may get involved (if you have not much money then you may have an appointeeship made to manage benefits and savings).
- The Court of Protection can make health and financial decisions on behalf or someone who does not have capacity to do so. They can also appoint someone to make decisions on your behalf. This may be a health professional or someone you trust.
- Having a deputy instead of having a person with LPA is more costly but there will be more supervision of a deputy in comparison to someone who has power of attorney.

### What should I do if I am having problems with the person given power of attorney that I selected?

- You can make a complaint if you are having problems with your attorney:
  - Contact the Office of the Public Guardian to raise your concerns. You can also contact your local authority social services. An investigation will then take place to assess these concerns (i.e. financial abuse).
  - Contact the charity <a href="https://wearehourglass.org/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hourglass</a>. It provides confidential advice to older people who may be experiencing harm or abuse.
  - If you are in immediate danger, call 999.

## Formally Recording Future Wishes

<div class="video-container">

You can make a record of your wishes for how you would like to be treated in the future – for example if you can no longer tell anyone. This can be used in a situation in the future where you may not be able to decide for yourself. You can choose whether you would prefer a formal document that is signed and legally binding, or an informal non-legal document that outlines your preferences. These future wishes might cover health and care.

### Types of documentation to record future wishes

There are two main types of documentation to record future wishes. One is a **statement of wishes** and the other is an **advance decision**. These are two different documents.

**Statement of wishes**

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/advanced-decision.jpg" alt="advanced-decision" class="legal-matters__advanced-decision">

- A statement of wishes is a chance to share your preferences with professionals and your family and friends. This document might be referred to in the future if you can no longer make decisions for yourself or tell people what you want.
- This statement can include preferences about what you might like to eat, where you would like to be cared for, what you would like to do, and personal care routines. It is best to write this down and include the date and your signature; if you do not then people are not likely to know what you wanted.
- Your GP, solicitor or Citizens Advice should be able to provide you with advice should you have questions around setting out your statement of wishes but they will remind you that no-one has to follow them and they may get lost or be unavailable.
- Important to Consider: statements of wishes are not legally binding. Whoever is making decisions should try to respect what you have said as best as possible. However, there may be times the decision will go against the statement. For example: you may have said you would like to stay at home, rather than go into a care home. However, it may become too difficult or unsafe for you to be cared for at home. Therefore, it may be in your best interests to move to a care home. You may say you would always prefer a bath rather than a shower. While that may not be possible always, it might help someone thinking about what to ask a care worker to help you with.

**Advance decision**

- An advance decision instructs health and care professionals and family to follow your wishes about refusing treatment. This can be helpful at a time when you may no longer be able to communicate or make the decision.
- Advance decision is also known as an advance decision to refuse treatment or a living will.
- An advance decision is legally binding providing it is:

1. in writing
2. signed by you when you had capacity
3. signed by a witness.

This witness does not have to be a health or legal professional. However, it is advisable that they are. Your GP could discuss potential future treatment options with you. GPs can also make sure that the document is valid and should be followed.

- Do not resuscitate (DNR) orders (also known as DNARs and DNACPRs) are specific types of advance decision. DNRs are a legal instruction to withhold any method of life support in respect of the patient’s wishes. You must complete this with a doctor present. Doctors may complete one too.

### What if the attorney I appointed does not agree with my advance decision?

If valid, your advance decision will overrule decisions made by your deputy or person given power of attorney (so for example the person with lasting power of attorney may want you to have antibiotics if you get an infection, but you may have said in your advance decision that you do not want to take them).

### When should I consider this?

Recording future wishes should be considered by us all as we get older. There are some advantages in doing them early and reviewing them. You may decide that you do not have any future care wishes. Or, you may have wishes about your care that you would like your family and health professionals to respect. Either way it is important to have this talk early and put your wishes in place. Over time, your wishes may change. If this does happen, you are allowed to make changes to your statement of wishes or advance decision.

### What should I do?

If you decide you would like to create a statement of wishes or advance decision, there are a number of steps:

1. You can write down or verbally tell family members or health professionals (most likely GP) of your wishes. If you write your wishes down and sign the paper this will help. This is to reduce the chances of your wishes being misunderstood.  
   NOTE: any advance decision with refusal of life-saving treatment must be in writing and signed by both yourself and a doctor.
2. There is no set way to complete a statement of wishes or advance decision but it is suggested that you include:

- **Statement of wishes**
  - Full name, date of birth and home address
  - Statement outlining your capacity (ability to make decisions)
  - Any preferences relating to where you would like to be cared for, food and drink preferences, what you would like to do, your religious beliefs, what you would prefer about personal care and what you would like to happen if you become unwell. You can add or remove preferences that you feel are important to you.
- **Advance decision**
  - Full name, date of birth and home address
  - Name and address of GP
  - Statement outlining your capacity (ability to make decisions)
  - Clear statement of your refusal of specific treatment
  - What circumstances this statement will apply
  - Demonstrating understanding of what could happen if you refuse treatment
  - Signature and date
  - Signature from witness (doctor if it involves refusal of life-saving treatment)

3. It is important that you share your statement of wishes or advance decision with health and care professionals and family. Without telling health and care professionals or family, they will not have a record of your wishes or instructions. Therefore, you may want to provide your GP and family with a copy of your wishes or decisions. Some people carry a crisis card or health alert bracelet to say they have an advance decision.
4. It is important to tell your family/the people supporting you if you want to change your mind. Without telling anyone, they will follow your original decision. You can make changes at any time, providing that you are still able to make your own decisions.

### What further support is available?

- **General Practitioner (GP)** – You can speak with your GP who will be able to provide advice on how best to write a clear statement of wishes or advance decision. The GP can also witness your advance decision document.
- **Parkinson’s UK** – Parkinson’s UK can provide general information around statements of wishes or advance decisions.
- **Citizens Advice** – Similar to Parkinson’s UK and Alzheimer’s Society, can provide support around the different types of ways to record formal wishes.

Here's a clear summary of your experience and the key points on making a will and dealing with discrimination:

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I have definitely got a ‘do not resuscitate’ notice on the back of my front door. I do not want to be resuscitated. You know, I‘ve had a wonderful life, a long life. I initiated it. So that’s firmly there. And I’ve written my own funeral service. It’ll be rather good. I’m debating a rehearsal.”
> (Person with Parkinson's)

## Wills

Taking the time to make a will can make sure your property and money are given to the people you want and divided in the ways you want. Without making a will, the law will decide who gets what.

### When should I consider this?

Similar to deciding on your lasting power of attorney and future wishes, making your will should be considered by everyone as they get older, as soon as possible. It is generally recommended to write up and sign your will at the same time as arranging a power of attorney. However, you may decide that you just want to write a will. Either way it is important to have discussions early with the people affected. Over time, your wishes may change or the things you talk about in your will have changed or no longer exist (e.g., you might have sold your car). If so, it is worth having these discussions again to make any changes in your will. These changes can only be made if you have the ability to understand the decision.

### What should I do?

If you decide you would like to make your will, there are a number of steps:

1. Take time to decide on how you would like your assets to be divided.
2. You can write the will yourself, although it is recommended to use a solicitor. By using a solicitor, it makes sure the document is legally valid and reduces any misinterpretation of your wishes. Some charities run free online will writing services and details of the national organisation coordinating this can be found below.
3. If you decide to instruct a solicitor, it is important before you start to get an outline of what they will charge and the level of detail in your will. Some solicitors provide a service for free, but this may not be enough for your circumstances.
4. Sign the document in the presence of 2 witnesses and have the 2 witnesses sign, in your presence. It may be recommended that your doctor acts as a witness to confirm you have ability and capacity to make these decisions. It is important that you choose 2 witnesses who have not been left anything in your will.
5. Once signed and deemed valid, the wishes outlined in the will must be carried out.
6. If you would like to make changes, you will have to make an official alteration (known as a codicil). You must get the official alteration signed and witnessed in the same way as when you made the will. There are no limits to how many alterations you can make.

### What further support is available?

- **Citizens Advice** – Citizens Advice provides information on a range of topics including legal matters and power of attorney (03444 111 444).
- **Parkinson’s UK** – The largest national Parkinson’s charity that can provide support on a range of topics (0808 800 0303).
- **Age UK** – Charity that can also provide support regarding legal questions (0800 678 1602).
- **Law Society** – The Law Society lists local solicitors that are registered within England and Wales.
- **National Free Wills Network** - The National free wills network provides free Will writing services to people who are accessing or supporting charities included in the network. Parkinson’s UK is included in the national free wills network. So, by visiting the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/get-involved/parkinsons-uk-free-will-services " class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> website or phoning them (0808 800 0303), you can get access to a free will writing service.

If you have a disability, such as Parkinson’s, you have rights that protect you from being wrongfully treated under the Equality Act 2010. This law helps to enforce and promote your rights to ensure you are not treated wrongfully based on your diagnosis of Parkinson’s.

### What should I do?

If you feel that you have been wrongfully treated (e.g. by your employer, the police or any other organisation), you have a right to make a formal complaint:

1. Firstly, consider if the problem can be resolved informally by talking the people involved, a disability advisor and human resources
2. If the problem is still not resolved, then ask to make a formal complaint. Each organisation will have their own complaints procedure for you to follow. If there is no complaints procedure, then make the complaint in writing anyway.
3. Contact Citizens Advice or the <a href="https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/contact-us/equality-advisory-and-support-service" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Equality Advisory and Support Service</a>. Both provide advice and information for the best approach on making formal complaints based on your personal situation.
4. If the problem is still occurring after the formal complaint then you may be able to contact an Ombudsman. An Ombudsman is someone who is independent, free and impartial who can be appointed to investigate complaints in certain areas. You can find your local Ombudsman through the Ombudsman Association, linked below.
