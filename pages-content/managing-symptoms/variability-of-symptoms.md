# Variability of Symptoms in Parkinson’s

## Introduction
Variability of symptoms occurs when people with Parkinson’s experience changes in the consistency and predictability of their symptom control. This may happen gradually or suddenly.  

- **“Wearing off”**: medication dose may not last as long as before.  
- **Delayed onset**: tablets may not “kick in” as quickly.  
- **On and off times**: periods of better or worse symptom control.  

### Definitions
- **Being ‘on’**: moving, thinking, and feeling well.  
- **Being ‘off’**: not moving, thinking, or feeling well.  
- Includes both **motor symptoms** (tremor, slowness, stiffness) and **non-motor symptoms** (anxiety, low mood, sweating, restlessness).  
- Variability may be **predictable** (related to medication) or **unpredictable**.

## What Might Be Causing It?
- Exact cause unknown. Likely related to how **levodopa stimulates the brain**.  
- Usually occurs after **longer duration of Parkinson’s**.  
- More common with **higher doses of levodopa**.  
- Other illnesses or infections can worsen symptoms, separate from “on/off” periods.

---

## What Should I Do About It?
- Discuss any changes with your **Parkinson’s specialist team**.  
- Some strategies can be tried at home to make fluctuations more manageable.  
- Medication adjustments may be possible under professional guidance.

## What Can I Try for Myself?

### Make the Most of ‘On’ Time
- Schedule activities during times when you feel at your best.

### Plan Ahead
- Off periods may worsen after an exhausting day. Plan rest or lighter activity after demanding days.

### Manage Stress
- Stress can increase symptom variability.  
- Relaxation strategies may help:  
  - Massage  
  - Acupuncture  
  - Aromatherapy  
- See the **Anxiety page** for more techniques.

### Medication-Meal Timing
- Consider taking medications **30 minutes before meals**, especially high-protein meals.  
- If levodopa on an empty stomach causes nausea, take it with **fruit or crackers** instead of protein-rich food.  
- Protein remains important for health and tissue repair.  
- See **Eating Well** for further dietary guidance.

## My Experience
- *“What I usually do is I’ll sit back and I’ll [..] take deep breaths and then I just sort of think, ‘calm down, just calm down’, you know, and sort of bring myself back again.”* – Person with Parkinson’s  
- *“We talked to him about changing his medication around, which he did do, and he took them a little bit earlier in the evening so he would feel a little bit more able.”* – Healthcare professional

## Further Assessment

### Questions You Might Be Asked
- Timing of fluctuations (when you feel “off” and how long).  
- How you feel at different times (stiffness, low mood, other symptoms).  
- Detailed medication history (dose, timing, and effect).

### Track Your Symptoms
- Use the **Symptom and Activity Tracker** to record:  
  - Times of “on” and “off” periods.  
  - How you feel during each period.  
  - Impact on daily life.  
- Helps you and your specialist **identify patterns** and guide medication adjustments.

## Symptom Monitoring
Try to **monitor your symptoms for about 3 days**. Recording details helps you and your healthcare team identify patterns and adjust treatment.  

### Things to Record
- Times you feel **‘on’** and **‘off’**  
- Timing of your **medication doses**  
- Meal times  
- Other symptoms, such as:  
  - **Dyskinesia** (involuntary movements)  
  - **Freezing** (temporary inability to move)

## Further Treatments

### Medication Adjustments
- Only change medication under professional guidance.  
- Possible changes your healthcare team might discuss:  
  - **Longer-lasting Parkinson’s medications**: e.g., long-acting levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors, or COMT inhibitors (like entacapone).  
  - **Dividing levodopa into smaller, more frequent doses**.  
  - **Additional “rescue” doses**: e.g., dispersible levodopa preparations for quick relief.

### Referral
- You may be referred to another service depending on your needs.  
- **Occupational therapists** can assess for extra equipment or support if daily activities are affected.  
- If variability remains significant despite medication adjustments, referral to a **specialist center** may be considered for advanced therapies:  
  - **Apomorphine**: dopamine agonist via injection, intermittently or as continuous infusion.  
  - **Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)**  
  - **Duodopa**: gel infusion directly into the gut.

## Key Messages
- Variability of symptoms includes **motor and non-motor fluctuations**, including “wearing off” and changes between **‘on’** and **‘off’** periods.  
- Tracking symptoms, lifestyle adjustments, and medication changes can help manage variability.  
- Your **Parkinson’s specialist team** can provide guidance and suggest additional options if needed.
