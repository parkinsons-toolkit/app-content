# Movement

## Tremor

Tremor is an uncontrollable, involuntary movement of a part of the body. Around one in three people with Parkinson’s never experience tremor. For others, it may be the most noticeable symptom. It may start in one area, like the right hand, and then gradually spread to another area on the same side of the body, like the right leg; it can eventually move to the other side of the body.

### What might be causing it?

Parkinson’s ‘motor’ symptoms – tremor, slowness and stiffness - are caused by having reduced levels of dopamine in the brain. It can be difficult to discern a Parkinson’s tremor from a non-Parkinson’s tremor.

Parkinson’s tremor is usually seen when the affected body part is at rest. This may be, for example, your hand is at rest on your lap or supported in some way and has a tremor. The tremor is sometimes called a ‘pill-rolling’ tremor. This is because it can look as if someone is trying to roll a pill between their thumb and forefinger. Besides the hands, a Parkinson’s tremor can also impact the arms, feet, legs, lips and tongue. It tends to affect one side of the body first and then, after several years, may spread to the other side of the body.

People also sometimes report the feeling of an ‘internal tremor’ that isn’t visible to others; sometimes a visible tremor appears later. Sometimes people with Parkinson’s will have a tremor that happens both at rest and also while they are doing actions.

**Non-Parkinson’s tremor** can be due to multiple factors:

- **Physiological tremor** is a normal body response to situations that provoke feelings of fear, stress, or anxiety.
- **Essential tremor** is usually seen when body parts are in motion – for example, a tremor that is worse with holding a cup and drinking; but can also affect the voice, head, body and legs. It also tends to affect both sides of the body from onset. It is a common tremor and it can be difficult to differentiate between this and a Parkinson’s tremor.
- Tremors can also be caused by some medications (such as salbutamol inhalers), caffeine, some imbalances of blood chemistry (such as high levels of thyroid hormones, or low blood sugar levels), and in response to withdrawal of alcohol having become dependent.

Whatever the cause, most tremors get worse when the individual is anxious or stressed.

### What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try for yourself as below. If despite these, the tremor is very bothersome, speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team routinely about possible changes to your treatment. Unfortunately treatments and strategies do not completely stop the tremor. The aim is to minimise the impact on daily life.

---

### What can I try for myself?

You may find different things that make the tremor more or less pronounced. Some things that have been researched are listed below.

**These may make tremor less pronounced:**

- Activities that decrease or manage stress or anxiety: yoga, tai chi, deep breathing exercises, self-relaxation techniques
- Some people find that exercise reduces their tremor
- Many people also find it helpful to talk with others with Parkinson’s about their symptoms

**These may make tremor more pronounced:**

- Stress or anxiety, or any emotional response
- Caffeine

Sometimes tremors can make specific tasks more difficult. Extra adaptations, support or equipment may be needed for those tasks:

- **Eating and drinking** – special cutlery or cups may help – see Daily Living page for more ideas.
- **Taking medication** – pill organisers may be easier to handle than the original packets – see Medication page for more ideas.
- **Technology** – some people find touch screen difficult to control with a tremor and find using a mouse easier; others use voice control. Most smartphones allow for voice dictation instead of typing. Similarly using a device such as an Alexa can be helpful. See our Reading, Writing & Technology page for more ideas.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “For me, my tremor can lead to tension/aching in the whole arm and shoulder. As it is primarily a resting tremor, I find it helpful to have something like a squeeze ball or fir cone to hold in the hand. Also, I find that using my hand for, say, knitting releases the tension in the arm.”  
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “A couple of things occur to me from my own experience of tremor; things I didn’t realise when I was first diagnosed. One is that some skills are so engrained in the motor memory that they seem to bypass tremor. So, for some people, their tremor disappears when they are driving, riding a bicycle, playing golf or playing an instrument. So keep practising those scales! It’s a ‘use it or lose it’ thing. Also, being diagnosed with a tremor doesn’t draw a line under acquiring new skills. I was inspired to start learning the piano by a woman I met on a Parkinson’s Patients Committee who had taken up the saxophone. I’m now working on my Grade Three pieces.”

### Further assessment

#### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section in your manual to bring to the appointment.

Things they might ask about:

- When does the tremor happen?
- Do you notice any response to medication?
- How does the tremor impact your daily activities?

### Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For tremor you could track your symptoms over 2-3 days, recording when the tremor is most bothersome, ‘on’ and ‘off’ periods if you experience them, and when you take your medication.

---

### Tests

Further tests are not normally required, unless there is a suspicion of an alternative cause of the tremor from the clinical assessment.

---

### Further treatments

Having consulted a healthcare professional, they may offer reassurance or further treatment.

#### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication if within their expertise.
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.

See extra information below about some medication used for tremor:

- Parkinson’s medication: See our Medication page for more information.
- Anticholinergics (e.g. trihexyphenidyl)
- Beta blockers (e.g. propranolol)

Some medications may increase tremors and so may be reviewed:

- Medication used for lung conditions (like asthma and COPD), such as salbutamol, theophylline
- Medication used for epilepsy, e.g. sodium valproate
- Medication used for mental health problems, e.g. Lithium
- Medication used to suppress the immune system, e.g. tacrolimus, ciclosporin
- Medication used in heart disease, e.g. amiodarone
- Levothyroxine
- You may be referred on to another service.
- If your tremor is causing difficulty with daily activities, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team may refer you on to an occupational therapist to help assess and decide if you might benefit from additional equipment or support.
- If your Parkinson’s specialist has exhausted all medication options and the tremor is still impacting your daily life a great deal then you may be a candidate for a surgical therapy such as **Deep Brain Stimulation**. If your Parkinson’s specialist team think that is the case they may refer you to a specialist centre for further assessment. See _Advanced Treatments & Surgical Treatments_ for more information.

### Key messages

- It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a Parkinson’s tremor and other causes of tremor at the time of diagnosis.
- Tremor can be increased by stress or anxiety
- Medications for Parkinson’s can help treat tremor

## Freezing

Freezing is a sudden feeling that you can’t start or complete a movement. Most people have **"freezing of gait"**, meaning freezing happens when walking. People describe feeling their feet are glued to the ground and unable to move, but they’re still able to move their arms.

It can happen at the start of a movement or in the middle of a movement (e.g. when you are starting to walk or in the middle of walking). Sometimes freezing can happen while eating, writing, or when you are rushing to do something. It is important to address freezing because it can impact on confidence and can contribute to falls.

## What might be causing it?

Freezing is a symptom of Parkinson’s. It often occurs in people who have had the condition for a long time but it can also occur earlier on. Freezing happens more commonly in **"off" periods** (when medications are not working as well) but can also occur in "on" stages.

**Factors that can make freezing more likely are:**

- Being in crowded or narrow spaces (e.g. doorways)
- Distractions
- Feeling stressed

---

## What should I do about it?

There are things you can try for yourself (see section _‘What can I try for myself?’_) but there are some situations where you should seek professional help. These include:

- Falling a lot
- Continuing to struggle with usual activities after trying the self-help strategies

It is best to seek help from your specialist Parkinson’s team or a physiotherapist (which may be through your GP).

---

## What can I try for myself?

The best thing to do if you think you can feel yourself freezing is to stop moving and hold on to your balance. Freezing can be a frightening feeling, but if you try to keep moving or become agitated you may fall.

There are different techniques that you can try. Some aim to overcome freezing when it happens, others aim to prevent it. You may find some work for you and others don’t. It is good to try out different strategies and see which suits you best. You might even find your own way to apply the principles.

The broad principles are:

**a) Attention & thinking**

- Focus on what you are doing
- Thinking ahead or visualising

**b) Using weight**

- ‘Weight shifting’ to free up part of the body
- Marching

**c) Cueing**  
This is using a ‘cue’ to keep movement flowing. Different cues can be tried:

- Visual cues
- Sounds
- Imagined cues

Thinking & attention
• Focus in on what you are trying to do.
• Think about putting your heel down first when taking each step.
• Think about big steps.

Reducing distractions may make this easier.
‘Visualisation’
• Athletes and musicians use this to visualize their tasks before performing.
• Imagine the movements for the whole task before starting it. Think about it step by step.
• For example, imagine the steps you need to do to get out of bed over and over until you feel confident in each step.
Using weight

1. Shift all your weight onto one leg
2. Count to three or 3. Step forward with say, ‘ready, the other leg steady, go’
   Or, rock your head and shoulders side to side to shift weight.
   Marching to prevent freezing:
   • Gives rhythm to walking.
   • Encourages big steps.
   • As you go through narrow spaces, try exaggerating the march even more.
   • As you turn, use big purposeful steps like a march, rather than pivoting.

Cueing
These can be used both to prevent and overcome freezing. a) Visual cues, for example:
• Ask someone to place their foot in front of yours for you to carefully step over. A rolled up newspaper or handle of an umbrella work as well, just be careful not to trip on it.
• Use a laser to create a beam of light to follow.
• Prevention: Stick bold tape to the floor in spots you commonly experience freezing. You could use a fan shape around corners and between rooms.
• Some equipment has been designed with lasers built in, for example walking sticks or frames.

b) Sound cues, for example:
• Use a metronome app or device.
• Count out loud or to yourself.
• Sing a rhythmic song or rhyme.
• Listen to music with a good beat.
• Prevention: count or sing as you go through doorways or other spots that trigger you to freeze. Use the momentum of the rhythm to carry you through.

c) Imagine a cue, for example:
• Imagine a sound (i.e. a beat, metronome or rhythmic music).
• Imagine a line in front of you to step over.

Environment
• Remove rugs or mats that cause you to freeze in your home.
• Remove clutter that makes spaces feel small.

My Experience
People by affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I’ve got some tricks up my sleeve now. Well, I did a very good CBT course and mindfulness, and I use a variety of techniques to unfreeze myself. I use counting for its cueing. I think to myself, I’m going to move on four; I’m going to count one, two, three and four, which is the cha-cha rhythm: one, two, three, cha-cha-cha…[then move forward]. Or you could target; you pick a spot the other side of what is your barrier, and you step onto that, a particular pattern in the carpet.” (Person with Parkinson’s)

“Sometimes she will freeze, and then if there’s a division, like from the carpet onto that mat, or tiles on the floor, then to get her to step over, tell her to step over that division. Sometimes I’ve told her to step over something that isn’t there, but just to get the idea of moving” (20 Carer)
Further assessment
Questions
• Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. Record this in your My Health section to bring to the appointment.
• They might ask how much the freezing occurs and when this happens. This is to see if there is a relationship to medication (e.g. If it only occurs during “off” periods or when both “on” and “off”) or if there are any triggers.

Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker
• This can help you to recall the details and help the professional see any patterns.
• For 3-5 days you could monitor your “on” and “off” times, freezing episodes, and when you take your medication. This will help to identify patterns in your freezing.

Further treatments
A healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment.
Medication
• Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
• If freezing happens during “off” periods they may adjust your antiparkinsonian medication.
• Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.
• Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) may also help freezing if it is related to off periods.
•

Referral
• You may be referred to another service. Please be aware there is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you.
• You may be referred to physiotherapy and/or occupational therapy who can teach you strategies for dealing with freezing. They can also support you to adapt your daily activities or environment to manage the symptom better.

Research is ongoing to look for new ways of managing freezing, including the use of new technologies.

Key messages
• Try out different self-help strategies for freezing to see what suits you. A physiotherapist or occupational therapist can help to teach you these.
• Freezing may be linked to “on”/ “off” times and may respond to Parkinson’s medication.
• Freezing can cause falls and injuries. It is important to let your GP, specialist nurse, or neurologist know if you are freezing during tasks such as walking and eating.
