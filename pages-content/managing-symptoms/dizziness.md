# Dizziness

Dizziness is often a difficult symptom to describe, and it can be challenging to work out the cause.  
People use a range of words to explain how they feel, and the medical terminology is complicated.  
Symptoms of dizziness can overlap with headaches, visual disturbances, or tiredness.

Although it can be difficult to decide which group dizziness symptoms fit into, there are two main types:

- **Vertigo**: a sense of movement when not moving.  
  - Classically described as a spinning sensation, but can also feel like being on a boat.  
  - Vertigo originates in the ear, brain, or nerves — the parts of the body that detect and interpret where your body is in space in order to maintain balance.  

- **Light headedness or feeling faint**: often harder to describe.  
  - Caused when oxygen to the brain is reduced. The body’s natural response is to lie down, so blood doesn’t have to flow against gravity.  
  - When blood pressure is low, oxygen to the brain is reduced, causing sensations such as:  
    - Feeling as though your legs give way  
    - Feeling off-balance  
    - Feeling faint  
    - Feeling *‘muzzy’*  

Many people experience balance problems or falls for other reasons.  
See the **Balance and Falls** page for more information.

## What might be causing it?

Dizziness is common in people with and without Parkinson’s.  
The most frequent reason in Parkinson’s is changes in the body’s control of blood pressure:

- **Postural (orthostatic) hypotension**: blood pressure drops when changing from sitting/lying to standing.  
  - Dizziness usually happens then, though sometimes with a delay.  

Other possible causes:
- Some medications — Parkinson’s drugs, high blood pressure treatments, heart medications  
- Infections, dehydration, bleeding  
- Anxiety or panic (more common in Parkinson’s; see *Anxiety* page)  
- Inner ear problems (e.g. **Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, BPPV**)  
- Irregular heartbeats  

**Not typical of Parkinson’s-related dizziness**:  
- Difficulty in hearing  
- Ringing in ears (*tinnitus*)  
- Severe headaches

## What should I do about it?

There are many lifestyle factors that can improve blood pressure fluctuations and dizziness for those with postural hypotension (see *What can I try for myself?*).  

But:
- If dizziness does not improve or recurs, and is affecting your daily life, see your GP.  
- If you develop new symptoms with dizziness, this should be medically assessed.  
- Assessment is more urgent if dizziness is frequent, or causes falls or loss of consciousness.

## What can I try for myself?

### General
- Do not stop all activity due to dizziness — maintaining activity is important  
- Pause and rest if needed, but try to stay active  
- Reduce alcohol intake (can worsen all types of dizziness)  
- Ensure you are well rested  
- Stay hydrated  

### Safety measures
These do not change the symptom but help reduce risks:  
- Take your time when changing position — rushing worsens dizziness and fall risk  
- Have something to hold when you stand up (e.g. furniture, grab rails)  
- Consider extra support in higher-risk activities (e.g. showering, bathing)  
- Avoid dangerous activities while dizzy (driving, ladders, heavy machinery)  
- You **must** tell DVLA if dizziness is *sudden, disabling, or recurrent* (see GOV.UK website)  

### Postural hypotension
- Maintain hydration  
- Avoid triggers:
  - Hot, stuffy environments (e.g. hot baths/showers)  
  - Large meals  
  - Straining (e.g. constipation)  
  - Standing for long periods  
- Move legs before standing to improve circulation  
- Shift weight between feet if standing long periods  
- Flight stockings may help (check with your doctor if circulatory problems)  
- Take time when changing position — allow seconds or minutes for blood pressure to stabilise  
- Raise the head of the bed by ~15cm (6 inches) using bricks, books, or pillows  
- Eat small, frequent meals (large carbohydrate meals lower BP); sitting after eating may help  
- Increased salt intake may help in some cases, but may also be harmful — speak to your GP before trying this  

For more information about blood pressure (including how to measure it), see the *General Medical Advice* page.

## Further Assessment

### Questions you may be asked
Healthcare professionals are likely to ask about dizziness.  
You could think about these in advance and record them in your *“My Health”* section.

Examples:
- Describe the dizziness (e.g. spinning vs. lightheadedness)  
- Under what circumstances does it happen? Have you noticed any triggers?  
- Lifestyle questions (e.g. how much water you drink, alcohol intake)  
- Other symptoms:  
  - Difficulty hearing  
  - Tinnitus (ringing in ears)  
  - Severe headaches or persistent nausea  
  - Palpitations  
  - Anxiety or panic  


# Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker

- This can help you recall details and help the professional identify patterns.  
- How best to track your dizziness will depend on how often it is a problem:  
  - **Infrequent dizziness**: record only when it occurs rather than monitoring all the time.  
    - Note what you felt, any other symptoms at the time, and the circumstances (e.g. *“Getting out of bed in the morning”*).  
  - **Frequent dizziness (daily or multiple times a day)**: record over a 3–5 day period.  
    - Include symptoms, when you take your medication, and your food/drink intake to look for a pattern.

# Tests

- Most of the time, blood pressure is checked and no further tests are needed.  
- In some cases, more frequent blood pressure monitoring is required.  
- Occasionally, further tests may be done depending on your symptoms, such as:  
  - **Blood tests** (e.g. to check for anaemia)  
  - **ECG** (electrical recording of your heart)  
  - **Head or neck scans** (rare)

# Further Treatments

Your healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment.  
Treatment will depend on the cause of dizziness.  

### Cause: Postural Hypotension
- Medication changes may help (made by your GP or Parkinson’s specialist).  
- Managing postural hypotension is challenging if you also have high blood pressure.  
- Some medication can worsen postural hypotension — these should be reviewed carefully.  
- **Do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking to a healthcare professional.**  

Examples of medication that can lower blood pressure:  
- **For high blood pressure**: alpha blockers (e.g. doxazosin), diuretics (e.g. frusemide, bendroflumethiazide), ACE inhibitors (e.g. ramipril, enalapril), calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine)  
- **For heart disease**: many of the above; beta blockers (e.g. bisoprolol). *(Note: beta blockers are also used for anxiety and tremor in some cases)*  
- **For Parkinson’s**: levodopa, dopamine agonists  
- **For bladder symptoms**  
- **For depression**  

If postural hypotension remains a problem despite lifestyle measures (see *What can I try for myself?*), medication may be considered.  
- Medications sometimes used: **fludrocortisone** and **midodrine** (not suitable for everyone)  
- Special stockings may be fitted to help support blood pressure  

### Cause: Vertigo (inner ear or balance problem)
- A physiotherapist or vestibular specialist may help  
- Treatments may be specific to the cause (e.g. physical manoeuvres for BPPV)  
- Referrals may involve a waiting time before the next service can see you  

See the *Anxiety* and *Balance and Falls* pages for more information.

# Key Messages

- Make sure to stay hydrated (e.g. by drinking more fluids)  
- Take your time when changing position (e.g. from sitting to standing)
