# Planning Future Care

•
that you’re likely to die soon – some people receive palliative care for years. You
can also have palliative care alongside treatments, therapies and medicines aimed
at controlling your illness.
What is end of life care?
End of life care involves treatment, care and support for people who are nearing
the end of their life. It is an important part of palliative care. It is for people who
are thought to be in the last year of life, but this timeframe can be difficult to
predict. Some people might only receive end of life care in their last weeks or days.
This information has been broken down into:

- Progression of Symptoms – things that might happen in more advanced
  Parkinson’s, though everyone is different and the symptoms are not certain to
  happen.
- Future Care Options – potential decisions that could come in the future if you
  were less well so you can consider your wishes.
- End of Life – things you might want to think about to ensure your wishes are
  respected at the end of your life.
  Progression of Symptoms
  Introduction
  Everyone’s experience of Parkinson’s is different. Just because some people
  experience the symptoms described here does not mean that you will.
  In general, over time people experience more symptoms, but there is no rule about
  which symptoms or when. For some people, the uncertainty about how things will
  look and feel in the future is one of the most difficult parts of the Parkinson’s
  diagnosis.
  Progression may involve the development of new symptoms or the worsening of
  existing symptoms. It may include an increasing difficulty controlling symptoms.
  Here we discuss challenges around progression and some of the more advanced
  symptoms. For other symptoms see the Symptom Management pages.
  Dealing with progression
- Long term health conditions, such as Parkinson’s, can cause different types of
  loss: from loss of ability to do things you could did before, through to loss of
  feeling good about yourself as a person.
- The sense of loss can go on for a long time, or occur repeatedly at different
  times in Parkinson’s as the condition changes.
- Grief is a normal emotional response to any kind of loss.
- ‘Stages of grief’ have been described as including anger and denial. In reality
  people do not necessarily follow through emotions in such distinct stages. You
  may experience different emotions at different times, all driven by grief. This
  can happen even long after you thought you had accepted the situation.
- Grief may also be affecting those around you.
- Sometimes grief can come before the loss. This is known as anticipatory grief.
  This is where the grieving process occurs due to the expectation of what may
  come.
  What can be done?
  It is normal to feel grief. It is helpful to acknowledge your grief. Understanding that
  grief is normal may be a comfort, as is knowing that there is support around for
