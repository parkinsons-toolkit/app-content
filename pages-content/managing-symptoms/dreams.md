# Dream Disturbance
## Dream Disturbances in Parkinson’s

Many people with Parkinson’s experience vivid dreams. For some, this is harmless, but it can cause distress or disrupt sleep for others, impacting daytime functioning. Movement changes during dreams are also common in Parkinson’s.

### REM Sleep and Dream Acting

- Dreams occur during **Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep**. During this phase, the body normally does not move.
- **REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD)** occurs when this paralysis is lost, causing people to "act out" their dreams.
- Movements can range from gesturing, jerking, and talking to thrashing, shouting, or walking.
- RBD is closely linked to Parkinson’s, though not everyone with Parkinson’s has RBD, and not all people with RBD have Parkinson’s.

### Causes and Contributing Factors

- **Directly from Parkinson’s**: Most vivid dreams and RBD in Parkinson’s are caused by the condition itself.
- **Other factors that worsen vivid dreams**:
  - Certain medications
  - Stress, trauma, anxiety
  - Changes to sleep schedule (e.g., jetlag)
  - Insomnia
  - Alcohol or illicit drug use, or withdrawal
- **More common in**:
  - People with some mental health conditions (e.g., depression, schizophrenia)
  - Those with other sleep disorders (e.g., narcolepsy)
  - People with other physical illnesses (e.g., heart disease)
  - Early pregnancy

### Safety Considerations

- Assess **risk of injury** to self or bed partner.
- Features requiring urgent attention:
  - Violent movements
  - Falling from bed
  - Walking beyond the bed-space
- Contact your **Parkinson’s specialist team** if urgent, or discuss with your GP if less severe.

- Assess if a separate bed or room is safer for a bed partner

---

## Further Assessment

- Record questions in advance in a **“My Health” section** to bring to appointments.
- Healthcare professionals may ask about:
  - Sleep patterns and disturbances
  - Medication timing and effects
  - Bed partner observations
  - Daytime impact on mood and concentration

# Tracking and Managing Dream Disturbances in Parkinson’s

## What to Track

When preparing to discuss dream disturbances with your healthcare professional, consider tracking the following:

- **Type of disturbance**: What exactly are you experiencing?
- **Sleep pattern**: Bedtime, wake time, night-time awakenings.
- **Lifestyle factors**: Exercise, diet, caffeine/alcohol intake, stress levels.
- **Mood and other symptoms**: Anxiety, depression, hallucinations, or other neurological symptoms.
- **Risks and impacts**: Falling out of bed, injury risk, impact on daily functioning.
- **Medication**: Timing, dose, and type of medications.

### Using a Symptom and Activity Tracker

- Helps recall details accurately for healthcare consultations.
- For dream disturbances, track:
  - Sleep pattern
  - Timing of dream problems
  - Medication schedule
- Monitor **at least three occasions** to identify patterns.

---

## Tests

- Usually **not needed**.
- Sometimes a **sleep study** may be recommended, which could involve a short hospital stay for monitoring sleep.

---

## Further Treatments

- After consultation, healthcare professionals may offer:
  - Reassurance
  - Advice on lifestyle or safety measures
  - Medication adjustments if appropriate

### Medication Options

**May be prescribed for dream disturbances:**

- Clonazepam
- Melatonin

**Medications that may worsen RBD:**

- Antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications (e.g., mirtazapine, SSRIs such as citalopram or sertraline)
- Always discuss any changes with your healthcare professional—do **not** alter medication on your own.
