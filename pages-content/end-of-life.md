# End of Life

- Do you have wishes for your body after your death? Your wishes can be written in an
  Advanced Statement. Some can also be planned or arranged in advance, for example:
- Registering to donate to research (more below)
- Registering for organ donation (more below) o Burial or cremation
- Funeral plans

For more information on formalising Advanced Decisions and Lasting Power of Attorney,

see the
Legal Matters page.
For guidance on what to include in an Advanced Statement or Advanced Decision,

see the Future Care Options page.
Practical preparation
Consider legal and financial matters. Are there loose ends to tie up? Are there details

you need to share? If you care or provide financially for others, think about the
arrangements for their future.
The Citizen’s Advice website has more information on the legal and financial aspects.
Their local offices can help you find a solicitor if you do not have one.
Legal and financial details that are helpful to securely record:

- Your records of wishes (as above).
- Bank account, debit cards, credit cards.
- Loans, mortgages, standing orders, direct debits.
- Accountant, tax or financial advisor, solicitor
- State benefits, pensions.
- Tax references.
- Inheritance tax matters: large financial gifts from the last 7 years.
- Property (ownership or rental), key holders and utility providers.
- Insurance policies.

Other practical considerations:

- Pets, and their welfare needs
- Online accounts or social media accounts
- Significant possessions, such as computers, phones, cars.

- Health contacts.
- Carer or care agency contacts.
- Employer details.
  Place of care
  The Housing page covers options for places of care. Here we consider options for
  places of care for someone who knows they are close to dying.
  There can be practical difficulties in moving to a new place of care if someone is
  dying. Understanding preferences can help to plan for it where possible. When
  making such decisions it is helpful to know what Palliative Care services are and
  what they can offer.
  Own home or home of a loved one
- There are services available to help support care at home at the end of life.
- Services may have different options for end of life care compared to earlier in
  life.
- Equipment can be supplied or recommended, to support staying at home.
- Details of what is available will depend on where you live. This can vary, for
  example how often someone could come to your home.
- You can talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team about this. They may
  refer you to a Palliative Care team to help support this process.
- Some people prefer to be at home. The advantages are:
- Familiar environment. o Comfortable. o Relatively private.
- Family close.
- However: o There can be difficulties with practical support if someone is not

there all of the time.

- Some people feel lonely if they live alone.
  Care home
- Many nursing homes have experience of caring
  for people at the end of life.

- Sometimes additional specialist
  support is offered by a community
  Palliative Care team.
- Some people prefer this option:
- There is always a member of staff around. o
  They have experience in caring for people.
- They tend to have private rooms, so can maintain a peaceful and private
  environment.
- They provide long-term care so can become a real home.
- However:
- For some people, it doesn’t feel like
  home. o Some people have negative
  associations with care homes.
- Care homes allow planned visits so you or your family could look around to help make
  this decision.
  Hospice
- Hospices are places that provide specialist care. They support people with a life-
  limiting or terminal illness. The focus is on improving quality of life.
- They are primarily charity-funded care, and are a limited resource.
- Some people prefer this option. The advantages are:
- There is always a member of staff around. o They are highly specialised in caring for
  people at the end of life.
- They tend to have private rooms. This means there can be a peaceful and private
  environment.
- However: o For some people, it doesn’t feel like home. o Some people have negative
  associations with hospices.
- Since they are a limited resource, it is not always possible to go to a hospice for end
  of life care.
- You can visit most hospices to help make this decision.
  Hospital
  •
  •
- Many people spend the end of their life in hospital.
- Many hospitals try to allocate a single room where possible when someone is at the
  end of life, but this is not always possible.
- Some people prefer this option:
- There is always a member of staff around.
- However: o Hospitals are more likely to be noisy and less peaceful.
- Private rooms are not guaranteed.
  Medicines towards end of life
  If the end of life is expected to be near, care tends to prioritise comfort and dignity
  A person’s usual medication may not be appropriate if they are nearing end of life.
  Medicines may be reviewed. These decisions are unique for the individual but
  generally involve:
- Stopping medicine intended only for long term benefit (such as tablets to lower
  cholesterol).
- Continuing medicine for current symptoms (such as pain killers).
  This is a delicate balancing act. Parkinson’s medicines are used to improve
  symptoms and so in general should be continued. They should be optimised where
  possible, to achieve best control of symptoms. The benefits and side effects must
  be considered, and these can change over time.
  Conditions also change over time: for example many people develop difficulty in
  swallowing pills. This may require a change, for example to medicine given as a
  patch on the skin (e.g. rotigotine patch).
  If someone is nearing end of their life, it is good to prepare for symptoms that may
  happen. This may involve getting medicine just in case it is needed. These
  ‘anticipatory’ medicines may include medicine to control pain, breathlessness,
  distress or agitation, nausea and secretions. These are considered for anyone near
  the end of life and are not specific to any medical condition. However, the choice
  of these medicines should take Parkinson’s into consideration. See extra
  information below about medicine details.
- Haloperidol, metoclopramide and prochlorperazine (used for sickness) should generally be
  avoided even in palliative care for people with Parkinson’s. They can worsen Parkinson’s
  symptoms.
- Alternatives such as cyclizine or ondansetron should be considered for nausea.
  Domperidone is suitable in Parkinson’s (but is not given by injection).
  When a person is dying, they may not be able to take pills so small injections may
  be used. These injections go just under the skin, rather than via a drip into a vein.
  If the medicine injection is needed very regularly, a ‘pump’ to give the medicine
  continuously under the skin may be considered.
  After death
  Who to contact after the death of a loved one
  This can understandably be a very upsetting and disorientating
  time. It is helpful to know in advance who it would be helpful to
  contact when the time comes. These include the GP, the nursing
  home manager, or the nursing staff if it occurred in hospital. Also,
  the Palliative care or Parkinson’s nurse will be able to offer
  support and advice. You may also like to contact the leader of
  your faith organisation e.g. priest, rabbi or minister. They can
  help you to find a funeral director, who will be able to advise further.
  Practical tasks
  After the death of someone there are a number of tasks that will need to be
  completed.
- Practical tasks after someone dies includes registering the death and making funeral
  arrangements. Further information about practical tasks can be found on the
  Government website (gov.uk). – Search “what to do after someone dies”

  Bere avement • Every person processes bereavement differently. It can
  be a difficult time for everyone.
- Many people use their existing social support, such as
  family and friends, to help them through.
- Some benefit from more information, support or
  counselling.
- Bereavement support is offered by many charities as
  well as local hospice and NHS services. For example, you
  could look at the Cruse Bereavement Care charity website.
- Try looking at the NHS website (search
  “bereavement”) or speak to your GP for more information.
  Organ & ti ssue d onation
- Many people are in need of organ transplants or tissues.
- The NHS have a register for those who are willing to donate their organs and tissues
  after their death.
- You can join this register when you register with a GP, apply for a driving licence, or by
  contacting them directly: organdonation.nhs.uk
- You should also discuss your wishes with your loved ones as they would be contacted
  about it.
  Donation to medical science
- You can arrange to leave your body for medical science: that is for research or training.
  For more information go to Hta.gov.uk and search body donation.
- Much research into Parkinson’s is ongoing. Some research looks at the bodies of
  people who had Parkinson’s after they have died to help understand the condition
  better.
- The charity Parkinson’s UK support a Brain Bank dedicated to Parkinson’s research,
  based at
  Imperial College London. For more information, see the Parkinson’s UK website.
