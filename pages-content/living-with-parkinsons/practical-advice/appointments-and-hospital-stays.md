> *The information on the practical advice pages was correct at the time of publishing. Live Well with Parkinson’s does not take responsibility for the accuracy of information within these pages or that found by visiting a link on this site. The content is for your information and should not be used as legal advice.*

Parkinson’s can affect day-to-day activities. But, there is lots of support available and there are many strategies you can try yourself. This section is about being aware of your options and ‘problem solving’ rather than medical aspects.

**Remember:** Asking for help is not a weakness. Part of managing your condition involves knowing when and how to find help. Asking for help can be difficult, but most people want to be helpful — they just might not know how.

## Finding Resources

This can be quite a detective job. Sometimes it can be quick to find the right information, but other times it can take a while to find what you’re looking for. We hope to provide specific pointers for more common issues in the pages that follow, but not everything can be anticipated.

If you need help that is not covered here, try asking yourself the following questions:

1. **What is the issue?**
2. **What is it that you need or want that might address it?**
3. **Who/where might have leads to find this solution?**

Some ideas to consider:

* Is there someone or a company on the internet or in the phone book?
* Your local council might have a helpline or a directory of local services. You can find your local council details on: [gov.uk/find-local-council](https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council)
* Can friends, family or neighbours advise?
* Are you aware of any services or organisations that might deal with similar issues?
* Is there someone in your community or social network who is well connected — the sort of person who “knows everyone”? They might have ideas.
* **Citizens Advice** might be able to help with a whole range of things. You can:

  * Get advice by email or chat online
  * Call their national phone line
  * Arrange to see an advisor locally
    For more details on how you can contact Citizens Advice and their opening hours, visit: [citizensadvice.org.uk](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk)
* A **‘link worker’ service** is being introduced in the NHS (from 2020/21). If they exist in your area, they will normally be a good source of local knowledge about support available. You can contact your GP to see if they are available in your area.
