Optimising Wellbeing
Every day you make choices that impact on
your health and well-being: from what you
do, to what you eat, to whom you see. This
section gives guidance on things you can do
to help you live well with Parkinson’s.
The advice to keep active, eat well and stay
social is, of course, applicable to everyone.
The guidance in this section is intended to
help you continue to lead a full life after your
Parkinson’s diagnosis, with any challenges it
presents. We
also want to highlight the current research showing the extent to which exercise can improve
mobility and overall quality of life in people with Parkinson’s.

  Making Changes & Keeping on Track
  Although everyone’s condition and circumstances are different, everyone has ups and downs. This
  can make it hard to ‘follow a plan’. There are different ways to approach this difficulty.

## Tips to consider:

1. Think about what is important to you: Focus on things that are important to you to keep
   you motivated.
2. Break it down: If a task or ambition feels big, break it down into a series of smaller steps.
3. Set a realistic target or aim: This is like making a New Year resolution. It should be specific
   and something you can achieve, so that you feel encouraged when you meet it.
4. Work with your body: Try to use the good times and don’t be too hard on yourself during
   the difficult times. If symptoms are getting in the way, read the symptom pages for tips on
   managing them.
5. Record progress: Some people find it helpful to keep a log of what they are doing.

- You could add your planned actions in a To Do List and check it off when completed.
- You could enter your activities to the Symptom & Activity Tracker to keep a
  record.
  This can also help you see which times are better for you than others.

6. Reflect: If something is not going as you’d hoped, think about why. What could you do differently?
   You might need to break it down into even smaller steps to make progress.
7. Reward: If it’s going well, reward yourself.
8. Forming a habit: If you want to do something on a regular basis, you want to make it automatic,
   like a habit. This takes persistence over time. For most people it takes about 3months for a regular
   activity to become a habit. To help:

- You could try associating the task with something that is already part of your routine, like
  brushing your teeth, or watching a scheduled TV programme. This gives an anchor.
  The My Wellbeing section in your manual will guide you through this process.
  Keeping Active
  Research studies have shown broad benefits of
  exercise in Parkinson’s. Activity is good for many
  aspects of life:
- Mobility
- Reducing falls
- Mood
- Sleep
- Bowels
- Overall health, including cardiovascular health Image: Freepik.com
  It doesn’t have to be a chore. Many people wonder how much and what type of activity they
  should do. They may wonder how to achieve it alongside their Parkinson’s. This will be different
  for each person. You may have questions after reading through the information below. If so,
  please speak to your physiotherapist, your GP or your Parkinson’s team. You should be cautious
  about suddenly significantly increasing your activity levels, particularly if you have other health
  conditions such as heart disease. If you are considering a drastic lifestyle change, discuss with a
  healthcare professional first for advice.
  Think of your activity and exercises to be like your medication. It is an essential part of treatment
  for your Parkinson’s. This advice is for everyone. The sooner activity is part of your life, the better.
  What is “Keeping Active”?
  In general, the more active you are, the better. It is important not to go beyond your limits.
  However, you should feel like you are pushing yourself.
  Different people will reach this with different activities. This will change over time.
- If the activity no longer challenges you, then step it up.
- If the activity has become too much, then roll it back.
  Everyone with Parkinson’s should be considered for referral to physiotherapy. This is even if you
  do not have trouble with symptoms. It can be helpful to tailor the recommendations about
  activity for you.
