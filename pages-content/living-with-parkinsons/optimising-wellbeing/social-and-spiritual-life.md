Some people with Parkinson’s withdraw from social activities. This can make the person feel more isolated and lower in mood.

Connecting with others can give you a sense of belonging and reduce loneliness, which are vital for health and wellbeing. Talking with friends and family about your condition can be a great form of support. It’s important to build and maintain positive relationships with those around you.

## What can I do?

**Ways to stay connected:**

- **See other people when you can:** For many people who live alone, they can feel more connected by simple things like going to the shops, a café or a local park regularly. Occasional conversations with neighbours or others around you can help you feel connected to your local community. This is shown to help with your overall well-being.
- **Make time for friends and family** by keeping in regular contact, by phone, video call or in person. This is an important step for strengthening your relationships. If you don’t do this already, maybe try to arrange a regular time or point in your routine to keep in touch. You could choose a regular time when you don’t have as much to do (e.g. weekends) and when you think you would have more energy to talk.

- **Talk about how you feel** to loved ones. Being open about your feelings can help you feel listened to and supported.
- **If possible, consider joining a local group** offering something you enjoy, such as drawing, creative writing, or singing. This will help you meet and connect with others with a shared interest. Many activities are offering an online alternative. You can explore options by typing in your postcode on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-a-community-support-group-or-organisation" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK's 'Find a community support group or organisation'</a>.
- **Access peer support:** Talking to people who share similar feelings or experiences can help you to feel understood. By going to a Parkinson’s support group, you can share with and learn from other people living with Parkinson’s, who are likely to be facing similar problems to you. Visit the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/local-groups" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK website</a> to find your local groups. They offer a range of groups, including those for people of working age. You can also use the <a href="https://forum.parkinsons.org.uk/?gclid=CjwKCAjwps75BRAcEiwAEiACMbbfAOacmU70Qe1bZEVQpY69TK346DcfTJjg4ss_So2JG2tBc48OkBoCrRcQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK online forum</a> which offers the space for you to talk to others affected by Parkinson’s.
- **Use the internet and social media:** If you are not already doing this, the internet offers many ways to stay connected, from staying in touch with family to finding local events. You can re-connect with old friends using social network sites (e.g. Facebook) or connect with younger family members using their favourite social media App (e.g. Snapchat). You could create a ‘group chat’ for family or friends using a messaging App (e.g. WhatsApp). You could also use online forums to find people with similar interests. If you would like to learn how to use a computer, contact your local library or council. Or contact Age UK, who offer local training sessions.
- **If you are feeling very lonely**, there are services that can help. Most GP practices now have access to a link worker. This person can help you to find something that suits you to help with feeling lonely. You can ask your GP practice reception about this. Some areas have services to connect you to volunteers who can help too. You can also call <a href="https://www.thesilverline.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Silver Line</a> on 0800 4 70 80 90, which is a confidential service open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It is designed to offer conversation, friendship, provide advice and link callers to local groups or services.

If mobility difficulties mean that you’re more reliant on the phone to keep in touch, it might be worth reviewing your phone package to make sure you’re on the best tariff for voice calls. One way you can do this is by getting in touch with your network provider to make sure you’re on the best tariff or call package.

Video calls can also be a great way of keeping in touch with friends and family as well as accessing, for example, exercise classes or religious services. If you’re not yet confident with this technology, there are guides on the <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/work-learning/technology-internet/video-calling/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age UK</a> site and on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51968122" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> site.

If reduced mobility is making access to shops and to social gatherings more difficult, then you could be eligible for a Blue Badge which will entitle you to priority parking. See our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/travel" class="internal-link">_Travel_</a> page for more information on the Blue Badge Scheme. You can also visit your council website and <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/help-getting-around" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> website for more information and guidance.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “It’s so nice to go out to a shop… because that brings you back into the community which is very important I think. One of the things you shouldn’t do is to lose touch with your community or communities.”
> _(Person with Parkinson's)_

> “My grandma lives in America so we don’t get to see her much. My aunt showed her how to use Snapchat on her phone - she doesn’t really use computers. She said it was easy to use once she was shown how. She sends me pictures of her garden and I send her funny photos of me or my sister every week. She says she really likes this as she lives on her own and cant go out now.”
> _(Family member of someone with Parkinson's)_

## Relationships

As your Parkinson's progresses, you may notice a change in your relationships. This might be with your partner, family, friends, colleagues, and so on. These changes may be positive or negative. For example, you may become more distant to some friends but build deeper connections with others.

When you feel ready, you may wish to have an honest conversation with your friends about your condition. It might be helpful to try to maintain closest connections with people who are supportive and willing to learn more about Parkinson’s.

It may be tempting to withdraw from friendships. However, it’s important to stay connected with those around you as they can be a great source of happiness and support.

### Romantic relationships

If you have Parkinson’s, or are caring for someone who does, you may find it affects your relationships. But there are things you can do which may help you either improve or adjust to these changes.

#### First reactions

The way you and your partner react to a Parkinson’s diagnosis can have an impact on how you feel. People can experience a range of emotions, including anger, frustration, denial and even relief. It is likely you will cycle through a number of different emotional stages after a diagnosis. You can expect to experience a period of adjustment for both you and your partner.

Parkinson’s UK run a ‘First Steps’ course for people who are newly diagnosed and a partner/friend. These are hosted by people who have Parkinson’s and can be a helpful way of coming to terms with the diagnosis and developing positive expectations. See the <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/first-steps-programme" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK 'First Steps Programme'</a> website for more information on the course and how to join.

#### Expectations

You and your partner may have different expectations of Parkinson’s. For example, one of you may be more optimistic about the future or have different views on how best to manage your condition. Try discussing your opinions with each other without judgement. This can help you both understand each other’s views and reduce any conflict. Make sure you have accurate information about Parkinson’s as this will help to make sure both of your expectations are realistic.

#### Emotional changes

After a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, some couples can feel a sense of grieving for the life they used to have. This can be due to the possible changes in lifestyle, personal identity, and working life. Also, symptoms such as involuntary movements (dyskinesia) and trouble controlling saliva can make some people feel self-conscious. They may then become withdrawn which can change the dynamics in a relationship.

The emotional impact of having relationship difficulties can make other situations more difficult to manage. Try not to deal with these emotions on your own. Talk with your partner about the relationship as this can bring you closer together. It may help you both feel more positive about the situation.

#### Changing roles

When someone has Parkinson’s, it is common for relationship roles to change. For example, you and your partner may take the roles of carer and cared-for. This can be difficult to adjust to, particularly if your relationship was very different before. Some couples can find it hard to see each other as equal partners in these new roles.

**Tips:**

- Maintain a sense of independence. Give yourselves time to do activities separately as well as together
- Take chances to reverse the caring role. For example, the person with Parkinson’s providing their partner with emotional or intellectual support
- Find activities that remind you that you are both equals, for example watching a film or socialising with friends
- Keep communicating with each other. Parkinson’s can affect communication in different ways, whether it’s verbal, written, or facial expressions. But it’s important to try to keep these channels open as much as possible
- Ask for help if you’re finding it hard to manage problems. Professionals such as Parkinson’s specialist nurses, counsellors, and psychologists can offer support and guidance.

### Intimate relationships

If you are in a relationship, sexual problems can affect both the person with Parkinson’s and their partner. Finding out one of you has a long-term condition can change your physical relationship. The need for intimacy may become more or less important. It can also impact your sexual self-esteem; the person with Parkinson’s may feel less desirable while their partner might worry about being too demanding by wanting sex.

Changes in sexual relationships can happen to any couple at any time, regardless of whether someone has a long-term condition. These challenges may resolve themselves. But, if this is not the case, a couple may wish to try:

- Making adjustments which take into account changing physical abilities
- Redefining expectations to fit with the circumstances at hand

If you both feel comfortable, it can help to have open, but sensitive, discussions about your desires and limitations when it comes to sex. This may make it easier to face the challenges and find solutions that work for you both.

For more information on Parkinson’s and sexual function, see our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/sexual-health" class="internal-link">_Sexual Health_</a> page.

### Where can I go for information and support?

- **Relationship counselling** – counsellors can work with couples and individuals (meaning you can go alone if you’re single or your partner does not wish to take part)
  - Ask your GP for services available in your area
  - Contact your local ‘Relate’ centre - visit their website to find your nearest _Relate_ and give them a call. You can find the link in our More Information section.
- **Counselling and psychotherapy for sexual problems** - counselling or psychotherapy provides a safe space to talk openly about any sexual problems you’re experiencing. It can help you to find ways of making changes
  - Ask your GP for services available in your local area.
- **Psychosexual therapy** - A psychosexual therapist is trained in all aspects of sex. They can help you to understand the effects of things like medication and illness on sex
  - You can see a psychosexual therapist on your own or as a couple
  - Ask your GP for services available in your area.

## Spirituality and religion

Spirituality and religion vary from person to person. It can provide someone with a sense of comfort and support. Your faith leader and community can be a great source of practical and emotional support.

If you have Parkinson’s, or care for someone that does, it can be difficult to attend religious meetings, due to practical and emotional challenges. There are many benefits of staying connected with your religious group/meetings so explore ways to overcome barriers to attending these (e.g. ask a friend to support you attending). If you need to arrange transport to attend religious gatherings, see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/travel" class="internal-link">_Travel_</a> page for advice. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic, many places of worship have offered online services, which are a great help to those with mobility difficulties.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I’m a Christian and I’m quite involved with our church and I spend a lot of time with people. And because I am sitting a lot of the time, people actually confide in me and like coming here, you know, and spending time in my home. I wouldn’t be able to do that if I was working. So these are the things that I have got to think positively about.”

### Fasting

<div class="video-container">

A religious practice that has particular challenges for people with Parkinson’s is fasting, for example for Ramadan. Fasting is thought to be safe for healthy individuals to practise. But, if you are older or have a chronic condition (such as Parkinson’s) you are advised to avoid fasting. Religious texts generally allow you to break fasting for these reasons due to the negative impact it can have on health. Fasting may cause someone with Parkinson's to have dehydration, weight loss, and metabolic changes. If medicines are not taken due to the fast, this can worsen symptoms and may cause withdrawal effects.

You should speak with your specialist if you are planning on fasting. They may be able to suggest adjustments to your treatment, including:

- **Extended-release dopamine agonists**
  Due to the slow release of the drug, you only need to take it once a day (e.g. at dawn before the start of the fasting period)
- **Transdermal patch**
  This delivers the medication through the skin directly into the bloodstream. As the drug is delivered without entering the gastrointestinal tract, the patch can be used without breaking the fast

These adjustments will not be suitable for everyone. Options will vary depending on the severity of the condition and current medications. Your specialist can assess this and discuss what adjustments will be suitable for you.

You should have a\*consultation one month after the end of a period of fasting like Ramadan. The specialist can then make sure control of the condition has been regained. They can also make any further adjustments to treatment if needed.
