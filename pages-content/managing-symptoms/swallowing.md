# Swallowing Difficulties
Some people with Parkinson’s have trouble with swallowing or eating. It can be more difficult to swallow certain foods, drinks, and medications. Your swallowing can be affected in different ways:
- Difficulty keeping food or drink in your mouth
- Difficulty swallowing food in one go, causing food to remain in your mouth
- Chewing food more slowly
- Trouble opening your mouth
- Coughing or clearing your throat when you are eating or drinking
- Feeling like food is getting stuck as it goes down to your stomach

Swallowing problems range from mild to severe and can happen at any time. If you notice any swallowing difficulties it is important you speak with your GP or Parkinson's specialist team. They can refer you on to specialists for treatment. Untreated swallowing problems can cause more serious health conditions, such as chest infections.

## What might be causing it?
The slowing and stiffening of muscles in Parkinson’s can contribute to swallowing problems. Muscles involved in chewing and swallowing (e.g. muscles in the face, jaw, tongue, and throat) can become less efficient and powerful. People with Parkinson’s can experience a dry mouth, tiredness, or difficulties concentrating at meal times. These can all make swallowing more challenging. Also, problems moving your arm or hand (for example, due to tremor) can make it harder to guide food into your mouth. 

Other medical issues can cause swallowing difficulties. These include weakness in muscles of the face or throat, and blockages or narrowing of the throat or gullet. Weakness of the face can happen for many reasons, for example after a stroke or injury. Other reasons for swallowing difficulties include poor fitting dentures, and tooth or gum health issues. 

Swallowing difficulties in Parkinson’s tends to happen gradually. Sudden problems are likely to be related to other causes. A professional assessment is often needed to identify the root cause.

## What should I do about it?
There are things you can try to make swallowing easier. However, it is very important to tell your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team if you have difficulty swallowing food, drinks or medication. They will need to assess the cause of your difficulties, particularly if they are worsening. This is because swallowing problems can increase the risk of more serious problems, like choking or chest infections. 

If you have new weakness in your face, you should consult your GP. Very sudden weakness, occurring ‘like the snap of the fingers’, on one side of the body could be a stroke. If this is the case, call 999 for an ambulance.

## What can I try for myself?

### Planning ahead
- Plan meals for when your medication is working
- Plan meals for when you are less tired - this may mean moving your main meal to lunchtime
- If you wear dentures, make sure they fit comfortably – see your dentist if needed 

### Medication adjustments
If medications feel like they are getting stuck, talk with your Parkinson’s specialist team and/or pharmacist. There may be a version available that is easier to swallow. 
- Some pills can be split in half, crushed, sprinkled on yoghurt or dissolved in the mouth o Anything that is “XR” (extended release) or “CR” (continuous release) should not be crushed.
- Check whether it is safe to crush or split tablets by discussing with your Parkinson’s specialist team or pharmacist. 

### Meal adjustments
If food is getting too cold while you are eating or you are feeling full too quickly, consider: 
- Smaller, more frequent meals and snacks
- Food that is easier to eat (e.g. softer foods such as mashed potatoes and bananas)
- Heated plates to keep food warm for longer
- Smaller portions and reheat a second portion if needed 

### While eating
- Take your time and eat in a quiet, comfortable place without distractions
- Try smaller mouthfuls
- Avoid taking another mouthful until you’ve cleared your mouth and throat 

### Drinking
- A speech and language therapist can suggest a suitable straw for you to use. This is important as if they are not suitable liquid is more likely to go ‘down the wrong pipe’ and into your lungs instead of into your stomach.
- Refill your cup or glass when it’s half empty, so you don’t have to tilt your head back to drink. Tilting your head back can make food or drink go down the wrong way.
- Very cold liquids can encourage swallowing – try drinking them first thing, before breakfast or with a meal 

<ins>_Tip: Swallowing Tip_</ins>
_When swallowing food or drink, following the process below step by step can help:_
1.	Take a small mouthful of food or drink
2.	Close your lips
3.	Chew well
4.	Take a deliberate swallow. Try to squeeze hard with all the muscles in your mouth and throat - this will push food down to your stomach and stop it getting stuck in your throat.
5.	Swallow again to make sure all the food or drink has gone.
6.	Try licking round the mouth with your tongue to check all the food has gone.
7.	Repeat steps until you are finished eating or drinking.

## My Experience

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions. Consider recording your answers in your “My Health” section to bring to your appointment. They might ask:

- Are you having problems swallowing food, liquids, or tablets (or a combination)?
- Have you had any unintentional weight loss?
- Do you have pain when swallowing?
- Has your voice changed?
- Do you have heartburn, nausea, or vomiting?

### Track your symptoms

Tracking your symptoms can help identify patterns and support discussions with healthcare professionals.

# Activity Tracker and Further Management of Swallowing Difficulties

## Activity Tracker

- It can be helpful to track your swallowing problems for 3 days to show healthcare professionals. This helps them identify patterns.
- Record the following:
  - When swallowing difficulties occur
  - Types of foods or drinks that are difficult to swallow
  - Any other issues related to swallowing
  - Timing of your medications

## Tests

- Most cases do not require further tests.
- If needed, your healthcare professional may recommend:
  - Blood tests
  - Camera tests to examine your food pipe (endoscopy)

## Further Treatments

### Medication

- Swallowing difficulties may worsen when Parkinson's medication has worn off. Adjustments to your medication regimen may help—discuss this with your Parkinson’s specialist team.
- Sedating medications can make swallowing problems worse.
- **Do not change your medication regime without consulting a healthcare professional.**

### Referral to Other Services

You may be referred to specialist services depending on your assessment:

- **Speech and Language Therapists** – Assess swallowing, teach techniques and exercises, advise on food consistency, and recommend suitable straws.
- **Occupational Therapists** – Provide equipment to assist with eating and drinking.
- **Dieticians** – Support people who are underweight and advise on diet adjustments.
- **Physiotherapists** – Help with posture while eating.
- **Hospital Specialties** – Ear, Nose, and Throat specialists or Gastroenterologists if a non-Parkinson’s cause is suspected.

If you are experiencing significant and progressive difficulties swallowing, see the _Progression of Symptoms_ page for further information.

## Key Messages

- Problems with swallowing tablets, liquids, or food can occur at any stage of Parkinson’s.
- Speak with your GP or healthcare professional as soon as you notice swallowing difficulties or if they worsen significantly. Early assessment may prevent more serious complications.
