## Driving

Being diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease does not automatically mean you have to stop driving. However, there are a number of things that you need to think about to make sure that you and others are safe on the road.

### What should I do?

It is a legal requirement to tell the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) of your medical condition as soon as possible. It is a criminal offence to not tell the DVLA of a medical condition that may affect your driving. Not telling them could result in a fine of up to £1,000 or prosecution if you are involved in an accident. It is also important to discuss your medication with your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP and how this may affect your ability to drive. This could be, for example, drowsiness, or feeling too sleepy in the daytime. Not declaring a health condition would mean your motor insurance is not valid. It is an offense to withhold information from your insurance company and so they should also be notified. See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">\_Legal Matters_</a> page for more information about insurance.

### Will my GP or specialist talk with the DVLA?

You will need to inform the DVLA, as this is not something your healthcare professionals can do. Healthcare professionals are only allowed to share your personal medical information with your consent, or if or if there is thought to be a public safety risk. This would be if they think you are unsafe to drive, for example. If, in such a situation, you continue to drive, they are required to break confidentiality and notify the DVLA. The DVLA may later ask for further information from your Parkinson’s specialist or GP with your permission as described below.

### How do I inform the DVLA?

There are two ways to inform the DVLA:

1. One option is to report your condition online on the government website: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/pk1-online-confidential-medical-information" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a>
2. The second option is to report your medical condition by completing the “Medical fitness to Drive” (PK1) form. This can be completed online (<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/6842f8e24d039a010411f071/pk1-confidential-medical-information.pdf" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a>) printed and sent via the post, using the address on the form. If you need a paper copy or more help, contact the DVLA driver medical enquiries line: tel: 0300 790 6806

Please note different medical conditions require different forms to be completed – for more information on this see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport/driving-and-medical-conditions" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a>.

### What happens next?

In certain circumstances, the DVLA will sometimes make their decision based only on the information provided from the PK1 form. DVLA state that they typically provide a decision within 6 weeks. If they require more information before making a decision you will receive a letter informing you the decision is still ongoing.
To help form their decision the DVLA may:

- Contact your GP or Parkinson’s specialist for their medical opinion.
- Ask you to go for a medical examination. This will typically be with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist.
- Ask for you to take a driving assessment to assess current ability.

### Can I still drive whilst waiting for the decision?

Under section 88 of The Road Traffic Act 1998 you may be allowed to continue driving whilst waiting for a decision. In order to continue driving whilst waiting you must meet all of the following criteria:

- Your doctor must have told you that you are fit to drive.
- You held a valid driving license and only drive the vehicles that you were allowed to before you informed the DVLA.
- If you drive a bus or lorry (Group 2 licence), your licence has not been withdrawn, suspended or refused by a traffic commissioner.
- You meet all the conditions that are set out on your previous licence that still apply.
- The DVLA has received your application (PK1 or PK1V) within the last 12 months.
- Your previous licence was not cancelled or refused due to medical reasons.
- A court has not currently disqualified you from driving.
- Your licence was not withdrawn as the result of being a high-risk offender on or after 1st June 2013. A high-risk offender is defined as a driver convicted of a serious drink driving offence.

The DVLA will not let you know if you fit the Section 88 criteria. Therefore, it is the responsibility of yourself and your doctor to consider whether you are safe to drive whilst waiting for the DVLA’s decision.

### The decision

The DVLA will typically inform you of one of four decisions:

1. **Your current license will remain without any restrictions**
   You can continue to drive as you have done before without any expiry date, review, or adaptations needed. However, if symptoms change or get worse you will need to let the DVLA know.
2. **A new short-term medical driving license is issued**
   You can continue to drive as you have done before but the decision will be reviewed again by the DVLA when the short-term license expires. The DVLA offer 1, 2, 3, or 5 year short-term medical licenses.
3. **Your licence is restricted to vehicles with specific adaptations**
   If you are required to adapt your car as part of the DVLA decision, you can visit a mobility centre for an independent assessment and equipment.
4. **Your licence is no longer valid and you cannot legally drive**
   If the DVLA’s decision is that you can no longer drive, they will give you an overview of how they came to that decision, and the reason why. They will also tell you if you can reapply for a reassessment in the future. Any fees linked with the application process will be refunded.

However, if you do not agree with the decision because the information provided was not understood correctly or you feel it is not a true reflection of your condition, you have a right to appeal. The DVLA decision letter will outline the details of who you can contact. You will need to give the reasons why you feel the original decision was wrong.

You may need to have a new medical examination or driving assessment in order for the DVLA to reconsider their decision. If you do not agree with their second decision you have a right to appeal to the magistrates’ court. This appeal must be made within 6 months from when the license was taken away or refused. You must inform the DVLA that you will be appealing to the court. For more information please read the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">\_Legal Matters_</a> page.

### Summary of the decision making process

1. Inform DVLA of your health condition.
2. Discuss with your Parkinson’s specialist or GP if you can continue to drive while waiting for DVLA’s decision.
3. Wait for DVLA’s decision (this typically happens within six weeks). You may be asked to have a medical or driving assessment.
4. You receive DVLA’s decision:
   - If they decide **YES**: You can continue to drive under the conditions they outline in the decision letter.
   - If they decide **NO**: You can appeal for a reassessment, appeal to local magistrates court within six months, or stop driving.

### What can I try for myself?

As already stated, you must inform DVLA of your medical condition. These are some suggestions for maintaining your safety as a driver:

1. Talk with your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP about how your medications may affect driving. If you feel very sleepy in the daytime you can discuss options of different medications or dosages.
2. Book yourself for regular sight and hearing tests. Make sure you have any aids that would help you when driving.
3. Avoid distractions – Parkinson’s can affect your ability to do several things at once; it is important that you keep your attention on the road.
4. Look into options of cars with adaptations that may make driving easier. These might be steering aids or hand controls. You can visit a mobility centre for advice.
5. Driving can be stressful and stress worsens symptoms of Parkinson’s. Try to reduce this stress by planning your route in advance and allowing yourself plenty of time.

## Parking

As Parkinson’s can affect your walking this section aims to provide you with helpful information and options. These will help make it possible to park closer to the services and places that you are visiting.

### The Blue Badge Scheme

The Blue Badge Scheme aims to help people with mobility issues (as either the driver or passenger of a car) to park closer to their destination. The blue badge is linked to the individual rather than a vehicle and so can be used in any car you are travelling in. This includes hire cars or taxis.

The key benefit to getting a Blue Badge is that it lets you park for free:

- In designated disabled parking bays on streets for as long as needed, unless the sign posting indicates a time limit.
- On streets with parking meters or pay and display for as long as needed, unless the sign posting indicates a time limit.
- On single or double yellow lines for up to 3 hours.
- Can be exempt from the congestion charge in Central London – there is an administration fee.

These benefits and parking rules apply to most of the UK but not everywhere in the UK. Examples of where there are different schemes include some airports, e.g. Heathrow Airport, and some central London boroughs, e.g. City of Westminster. The Government website <a href="https://www.gov.uk/health-conditions-and-driving" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a> has more information.

_Please check with local boroughs guidelines for parking schemes._

It is also important to know that the Blue Badge is for street parking. You will need to check the signs for private parking to see if you still have to pay. Such places would be parking in hospitals or supermarkets. You will still have to follow all other standard parking regulations.

### Who is entitled to a Blue Badge?

Some individuals can receive automatic qualification whilst other people may have to qualify through an assessment.

**<ins>Eligibility for Blue Badge</ins>**
You may **automatically** qualify for a Blue Badge if you meet **any one** of the following:

- In receipt of the higher rate of the mobility component within the Disability Living Allowance.
- In receipt of a Personal Independence Payment because you cannot walk more than 500 metres (score of 8 points or less for the “moving around” activity).
- In receipt of the mobility component of the Personal Independence Payment and obtain 10 points for the “planning and following journeys” activity.
- Receiving the War Pensioners’ Mobility Supplement.
- Been certified as having a permanent and substantial disability which impacts your ability to walk and have received a lump sum benefit within the tariff levels 1-8 of the Armed Forces and Reserve Forces Compensation Scheme.

If one or more of the following situations applies, you **might** be asked to do a mobility assessment. This is where a health professional assesses your mobility and advises the council on whether you need a Blue Badge:

- Unable to walk.
- Experience difficulty walking due to pain, breathlessness, or need support from someone/mobility aids.
- Be at serious risk to yourself or others when walking.

If your condition improves and you no longer need the Blue Badge, you must return the badge to the council or you could be fined.

### How do I apply for a Blue Badge?

You can apply for your Blue Badge on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK's 'Apply for or renew a Blue Badge'</a> page, which will direct you to your local council site to apply online. Someone else can apply on your behalf, but they will need access to your supporting documents (e.g., proof of identity, proof of address, a passport-sized photo, and supporting evidence).

You will usually need to provide supporting evidence of your medical condition, such as:

- A letter from your specialist
- A summary of your health conditions from your GP
- A letter from a social worker

Your council website will tell you exactly what you need to provide. Some councils offer telephone helplines or postal applications. Please check with your local council. There is usually a small fee for the Blue Badge.

The badge typically lasts up to 3 years before you need to renew. You must apply for renewal before the old one expires. Councils usually aim to make a decision within 12 weeks.

### Tips and Advice for Applying for a Blue Badge

When applying for a Blue Badge it is important to clearly explain how your condition impacts your mobility and what risks you face without a Blue Badge. For example, carrying heavy shopping bags leads to balance issues, increasing the risk of falls.

### What can I try for myself?

1. Check eligibility and apply for a Blue Badge.
2. Plan ahead and check if disabled parking bays are available.
   - This could be done by using BlueBadgeParking.com, or
   - Phoning the place you are visiting, or
   - By using <a href="https://bluebadgeparking.com/view/48.439567%2C-23.89375%2C59.430675%2C18.29375/road" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueBadgeParking.com</a> - a worldwide crowd-sourced database of disabled parking places. The database is edited by the general public to add disabled parking bays not listed on the website. There is also an app available.
3. Make sure you display your Blue Badge correctly on the dashboard showing the hologram and parking clock.

- Some applications will require you to provide further information or possibly undergo a mobility assessment to see if you qualify to use that service.

**<ins>Taxicard Scheme</ins>**

- Some councils offer a **Taxicard** scheme to subsidise taxi fares, reducing the cost for users.
- As for many of these services, you will need to contact your local council to see what is offered locally. You can find your local council’s website by entering your postcode on the government website, under “find local council”
- London Taxicard information and applications are available on the London Councils website.

_Please note that Attendance Allowance cannot be used to lease a car through Motability scheme._

### What Can I Try for Myself?

1. Check eligibility for each scheme and apply for those that suit your needs.
2. Plan trips carefully as some transport options need advance booking.
3. Applying for multiple schemes increases your transport options (e.g., if Dial-a-Ride isn’t available, then you can use your Taxicard).

### My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “…the chance to meet with a colleague's neighbour who had Parkinson's for some time. Seeing him still enjoying life—driving, working, travelling—was a big step to helping me get back on my feet after the diagnosis.”  
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

## Finding Toilets When Out and About

Parkinson’s may make accessing toilets more difficult due to mobility or bladder symptoms.

## Flying and Travelling Abroad

Flying and travelling abroad with Parkinson’s is still possible, with many people still enjoying breaks and holidays. The condition should not stop you from arranging new holidays in the future. There are some extra things to think about when planning that can help to reduce potential worries.

### Am I Safe to Travel?

- **Consult your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team before traveling.** It is recommended that you speak with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team about your travel plans so they can provide their advice. This may include how to best manage medication whilst you are away.
- **Take an extra week’s supply of medication** It is wise to take an extra week’s worth of medication with you. Keep this in your carry-on baggage in case of lost baggage or delays.
- **Keep medicines and medical equipment in original, clearly labelled packaging.**
- **Carry a medical letter or summary** Your GP can provide you with a medical letter or medical summary outlining that you have Parkinson’s and the medication you are taking. This might be needed if you feel ill whilst abroad or if you are stopped at security or customs. Please note your GP practice may charge for writing such a letter, as this service is not typically covered by the NHS. Alternatively, you could take a copy of a recent letter from a visit to your specialist if it contains up to date details of your condition and medications. Having a medical letter outlining your condition and medications is also a good idea if you have been prescribed tablets for sleep, anxiety, or pain. These medications are closely monitored in the UK and other countries.
- **Inform the travel company of your condition** at least 48 hours before your trip. This will allow the company to provide the best possible support to you during your journey.

### Can I Fly?

- Parkinson’s does not stop someone from flying. It is important however to consider that symptoms may make it more difficult (e.g. stiffness or walking problems) or be made worse (e.g. anxiety, sleep).
- If you are flying, it is important to stay hydrated to reduce symptoms. Therefore, drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration.
- You may want to book a seat at the front of the plane, or in a seat where you can have extra leg room.
- It is against the law within England and Europe for an airline to prevent anyone booking or boarding a flight due to a disability.

</iframe>
</div>

### Going Abroad

- Plan for possible medical needs while on holiday. There could be instances where you will need to get medical assistance whilst on holiday. Think about how you could access this in advance.
- Check country-specific travel advice on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a> website under “foreign travel advice” or contact the embassy of the country you intend to visit.
- See your GP or private travel clinic to get any necessary vaccines at least 8 weeks before travel.
  - Some vaccines need time to develop immunity, others need multiple doses given over weeks or months.
  - You can see more information on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/vaccinations/travel-vaccinations/travel-vaccination-advice/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Travel Vaccinations</a> page or,
  - Visit the <a href="https://travelhealthpro.org.uk/contact" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Travel Health Pro</a> webpage for more detailed, country-speicifc information on recommended vaccines.
- The **UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC)** has replaced the existing European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) for subsidised healthcare in the EU. The GHIC allows you free or subsidised treatment across the European Economic Area (EEA) countries. This is not a replacement or alternative to travel insurance. You should have both. For more information or to apply visit the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Healthcare Cover Abroad</a> page.
- There are similar agreements that the UK has with other countries in regard to free or subsidised treatment costs.

Note: travel insurance is covered in <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/legal-matters" class="internal-link">\_Legal Matters_</a>.

### What Can I Try for Myself?

1. Talk with your GP about your travel plans and seek advice
   - Discuss medication management
   - Ask about a medical letter outlining your conditions and medication, particularly if you are taking medications prescribed by your doctor for pain, anxiety or sleep
2. Carry medicines and medical equipment in their original, correctly labelled packages.
3. Bring one additional week’s worth of medications with you in your carry-on baggage. This is in case of delays or lost baggage.
4. Contact the company you are travelling with at least 48 hours before to inform them you have Parkinson’s so they can provide necessary support needed.
5. Keep well hydrated and drink fluids regularly on any type of journey, especially if you are flying.
6. Apply for your Global Health Insurance Card, these have now replaced the European Health Insurance Card. Please note these do not replace travel insurance.
7. Seek medical treatment if unwell when abroad

### My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I take sealed bottles of spares medication on any trip abroad. I take one in my hand baggage and one in my hold luggage. If something happens to either my hand luggage or hold luggage, I still have medication. If nothing happens to either, then I have extra which is handy if I get severely delayed because volcanic ash or a worldwide pandemic halts air travel.”
