# Complementary Therapies

Complementary Therapies
Complementary therapies are a group of therapies that
have until recently stood outside of usual Western
healthcare. They are becoming increasingly used
together with mainstream medicine. An example would
be using acupuncture as well as the more usual pain-
killing tablets to help lessen discomfort following
surgery.
Complementary therapies are considered different to
Alternative Therapies. Alternative Therapies are generally used instead of
conventional treatments. An example of this might be using homeopathy or herbal
remedies and no conventional medications.
These are not discussed here.
Complementary therapies are generally considered to be holistic. This means they
usually include all aspects of physical, mental and emotional health. This is
because these are all seen as closely connected. For example, a complementary
therapist would look at how a condition affects the whole of someone’s life. They
would not just look at a symptom on its own. This might mean that a therapist
suggests dietary and lifestyle changes as well as offering a physical therapy.
Complementary therapies are often used to boost physical and emotional
wellbeing. Some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of
using them.
What are they?
There are many complementary therapies, and so we cannot provide a complete
list. Many complementary therapies have not had rigorous scientific testing and
we are not able to say whether they work or not. It is not possible to recommend
or endorse any therapy in particular. Different therapies may work for different
people. The following are just some of the better-known complementary therapies
available. You may like to look into these further:
- Acupuncture
- Acupressure
- Alexander technique
- Aromatherapy
- Art therapy
- Craniosacral therapy
- Massage
- Meditation
- Mindfulness
- Music therapy
- Osteopathy
- Pilates
- Reiki
- Reflexology
- Tai chi
- Visualisation
- Qi gong
- Yoga
Some of these physical therapies, for example Pilates, are used to improve flexibility,
strength, posture, and body awareness. Others, like mindfulness, mainly relate to thoughts
and feelings.
Physical t herapies
Some physical therapies, for
example Pilates, Qigong and yoga,
are activities that can be carried
out alone. They can also be carried
out in a group under guidance.
These three activities have some
variations between them, but all
involve stretching, gentle
movements, and holding
particular postures. They have the
aim of improving strength, balance, flexibility, posture and breathing
techniques. These are thought to improve general fitness and wellbeing.
Other physical therapies are carried out by a therapist. Such examples would be
acupuncture, acupressure or reflexology. In these treatments the therapy is the
insertion of fine needles, or pressure at certain points in the body. This simulates
•
•
nerves under the skin and in the muscles and causes the body to produce natural
substances. Some of these natural substances cause relaxation and reduce pain.
In osteopathy a therapist uses physical manipulation, stretching and massage. This
has the aim of increasing joint movement to relieve muscle tension.
Therapies that focus on thoughts and feelings
These activities include Mindfulness, Meditation and Visualisation. These can be
practiced in a group under guidance, or practiced alone. These three examples
have variations between them, but in all cases their practice helps focus the mind.
For example, the person practicing mindfulness is encouraged to focus only on the
present moment. They pay attention to any thoughts and sensations without
thinking about what they might mean or getting caught up in them. A similar
example is Visualization. This is a practice of imagining or meditating, with a focus
on chosen images. The aim of these practices is to focus the mind. This is instead
of getting caught up with unhelpful ways of thinking that we sometimes can do,
such as thinking about the past or imagining what the future might be.
Potential Benefits
As will be discussed in the section below How do I know if it is trustworthy?
research studies are helpful in showing if certain therapies can be suggested as
being helpful. Few Complementary therapies have been rigorously researched.
There is a need for more research. Particularly research into their use by people
with Parkinson’s. Some smaller studies have been carried out, and people with
Parkinson’s report having found certain therapies helpful. A Parkinson’s UK survey
of people with Parkinson’s reported a range of benefits from having used a variety
of Complementary therapies. Benefits included a sense of wellbeing, increased
relaxation and a sense of control of their condition and symptoms. If you are
interested in reading more please follow the link at the bottom of the page.
Complementary physical therapies in Parkinson’s
The Alexander technique teaches you to be more aware of your body and posture.
It also teaches how to move more efficiently. Evidence from a small research study
suggests that this technique may help with symptoms of pain, speech, tremor,
depression and balance.
There is increasing research looking at the psychological and physical benefits of
Qigong and Tai Chi. There are also many published studies about yoga. Studies
about yoga suggest that it is a safe and effective way to increase physical activity,
strength, flexibility and balance in those with mild Parkinson’s. The health benefits
of Pilates are reported as including improving posture, muscle tone, balance and
joint mobility. Comments from people with Parkinson’s support that Pilates can be
positive.
Massage can be used to reduce stress, pain and
muscle tension. It can also be used to help people
relax. In a similar way Reflexology is often used to
increase relaxation. Reflexology is a type of
massage that involves applying different amounts
of pressure to particular areas on the feet, hands,
and ears. It is also believed by people who practice
it that it can help with a wide range of problems,
including difficulty sleeping and problems with
digestion. A small study suggests that it may help
with the wellbeing of people with Parkinson’s.
A review of studies using acupuncture, a therapy which is discussed above,
suggests that it might be a safe and useful additional treatment for people with
Parkinson’s.
Therapies that focus on thoughts and feelings
In recent years there has been an increase of interest in the inter-relationship
between the mind and the body. Many of the physical practices described above
help with relaxation. In the same way it is increasingly being shown that our
thoughts can drive our emotions and behaviours. These in turn can then impact
physical health. It has been suggested that practices like Mindfulness can help us
better understand ourselves, and this body-mind relationship. Mindfulness is
recommended by the NHS as one of the five steps to mental wellbeing.
Meditation, for example, has been used worldwide for thousands of years.
Although often thought to be linked with religion and spirituality, it is described as
being beneficial to mood and stress. It is increasingly used for health reasons.
Research scans of the brain have shown changes in brain activity during
meditation.
It has been suggested that music can improve movement and speech. It can also
help people to relax. Some people with Parkinson’s find that listening to strong
rhythmic music can improve their walking, prevent hesitations and overcome
‘freezing’ episodes. In general, research suggests that music seems to help people
with conditions such as Parkinson’s to improve their emotional sense of wellbeing.

It has been suggested that doing
creative activities can help people
focus their mind and relax. Doing
creative activities can also help people
express their emotions in a positive
way. Art can also be used this way. Art
Therapy is a form of psychotherapy
that uses art as a way of
communicating feelings and thoughts.
Therapies that take place in groups, for example art or music therapy, can
be social. Some people can find it supportive to be
with others who have the same condition. Group activities in a variety of settings are used
to help people relax or talk about their feelings or ideas.
Potential Risks
Although there is more interest and research into Complementary therapies, there
is still a lot unknown. This is particularly so for use by those with Parkinson’s. As
there is still a lot unknown about some complementary therapies it is best not to
use them to replace the therapies your specialist Parkinson’s team or GP may
advise using. If you are thinking of using a complementary therapy it would be
best to first discuss this with your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. This is because
some complementary therapies might be unsuitable for people with certain
underlying medical conditions.
Note some herbal medicines interact with Parkinson’s medications.
If your healthcare team have no objections and support your use of a particular
complementary therapy, it is always worth asking the individual therapist about
the potential risks. Also good to ask what steps they will take to avoid any risks.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“ – my posture is not great. And I felt I wanted to do something for myself.
And so, I applied for Pilates. So I contacted a body control Pilates teacher.
And she’s been good because she picks me apart and then works on my
posture and core stability”. Person with Parkinson’s
“ I find some yoga stretches really help” Person with Parkinson’s
How do I access these?
Some complementary therapies are available on the NHS. For example, massage,
aromatherapy and acupuncture are available through some hospitals, GP
practices, physiotherapists, pain clinics and hospices. Osteopathy and mindfulness
groups are also sometimes available through referral by GP practices. Some local
Parkinson’s UK groups offer relaxation therapies. Some offer regular creative
sessions, including art classes. If you are interested in doing something creative an
Occupational therapists may also be able to offer advice and suggestions.
If you are caring for someone with Parkinson’s you may be able to access low cost
or free therapies. These may be available through the NHS, local councils and
charities in some areas. Many carers find that complementary therapies offer an
enjoyable way to reduce stress and have time for themselves.
GP’s or local Parkinson’s UK supporter may be able to advise.
You may have to pay to see a complementary therapist if the therapy you are
interested in is not available on the NHS or through Parkinson’s UK local groups.
You may be able to find a suitable therapist through your healthcare professional,
or local Parkinson’s UK advisor. Your local council or
library may have information about nearby classes.
Before enrolling with a complementary therapist it is
worth making sure they are reputable and insured.
Where relevant, that they belong to a regulatory body.
You should not feel embarrassed to ask them this
information, and about their qualifications. The
Complementary and
Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC)
[https://www.cnhc.org.uk/ have a regi](https://www.cnhc.org.uk/ have a regi)ster of approved practitioners, which may
be a helpful way of finding someone suitable. The British Acupuncture Council
(BAcC) has a register of acupuncturists all over the UK who must adhere a strict
code of practice to be a member: [https://www.acupuncture.org.uk/find
How do I know if it i](https://www.acupuncture.org.uk/find
How do I know if it i)s trustworthy?
To understand whether a therapy is safe and effective, we need to check the
evidence for it. Conventional medications and healthcare products go through a
rigorous scientific process. This is to prove safety and effectiveness before they
can be prescribed by doctors. This process is managed by the government agency
Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This is not the
case for complementary therapies. Although more research studies are being
•
•
done into the effectiveness of complementary therapies they are not tested in the
same way.
Unfortunately, not all research studies are large enough to be able to show
concrete evidence for how safe and effective they are. When finding out about a
therapy and reading the research it is always worth asking questions about the
research. This is to make sure you are reading something accurate and not
misleading. For example, is the research published somewhere trustworthy? Who
has done the research? Is it peer reviewed (checked for accuracy by other
researchers)? Did the research include large enough numbers to be able to draw
conclusions from the findings? For some complementary therapies it is not
possible to ‘prove’ their benefit using this scientific approach, but many people
with Parkinson’s report that they find them helpful.
Another way of checking if a therapy is trustworthy is to check the way it is
regulated. Just like the safety testing of medications, the practice of conventional
Western medicine is regulated by laws. These make sure that practitioners are
properly qualified and are guided by standards and codes of conduct. An example
is the General Medical Council (GMC) which regulates doctors. A couple of
complementary therapies are regulated in a similar way. These are osteopathy and
chiropractic treatments. Art therapists and some other practitioners must be
registered to practise. This is not the case for all Complementary therapists. This
means that standards can vary and there is no responsibility to practice in a
particular way.
There have been steps to address this. The Complementary and Natural
Healthcare Council (CNHC) has been set up to be the independent UK regulator
for some types of complementary practitioners. This has government support. The
voluntary register of practitioners has been approved by the Professional
Standards Authority. This is, a body accountable to Parliament. Those registering
must have approved qualifications. They must meet standards to remain on the
register. Many of the therapies listed above appear on the register. Some are not
regulated by law but the therapists can register with a professional body and be
insured to work. There are also a number of professional organisations for
individual complementary therapies. These govern activities to ensure they
adhere to certain standards or codes of practice e.g. Acupuncture Association of
Chartered Physiotherapists, The British Acupuncture Council, The British
Association of Art Therapists, General Council for Massage Therapies. If you are
interested in using a Complementary therapist it is worth finding out if they are
members of such associations.

Further
Support
Information,
Websites & Apps
When diagnosed with Parkinson’s, you may want
to seek out extra information to that given by the
health professionals supporting you. This can
help you to better understand the condition and
understand how to manage any symptoms. There
are a number of places you can find information.
This can be on the internet, from applications
(‘apps’), in books, libraries, information
organisations such as Citizens Advice, and from
support groups. There can be a huge amount of
information to take in. This can be especially so when searching the internet or
when downloading health apps to your electronic device. The information may
seem to be contradictory and it can sometimes feel confusing to know what
information is accurate. It can also be hard to know what information to use for
yourself. It is always good to ask the health professionals around you any questions
you have, and about the extra information you have found.
This section provides guidance on the different sources of information and some
examples of good sources of information.
Websites
There are a lot of websites offering information. Be cautious about carrying out
general internet searches and using information from any website without
checking that is it accurate and safe. Try to get your information from known
reliable sources. Such sources would be government and NHS websites and
reputable charities such as Parkinson’s UK and the Cure Parkinson’s Trust in this
country. There is also the Parkinson’s Foundation and the Michael J Fox Foundation
based in the U.S.
but with an international reach.
