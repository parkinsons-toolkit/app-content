Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments
Apomorphine
injections
What is it?
Intermittent injections of a medicine called apomorphine (a dopamine agonist).
The injections go into the skin, a bit like an epi-pen or insulin pen. The medication works
quickly, in 5-10 minutes. It lasts for about 40 minutes.
Who is it for?
You may be able to have this treatment if:
•
•
- You are diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have specific difficulties, such as:
- Significant periods where the medication has become less effective, ‘off’ periods.
- Your symptoms respond well to medication.
Symptoms that don’t get better with other Parkinson’s medications don’t
tend to improve with apomorphine injections either. These may include
problems with speaking, swallowing, falling due to loss of postural reflexes,
or ‘freezing’ when the medication is otherwise working well (‘on’ periods).
These may also include other non-motor symptoms such as apathy,
drooling of saliva, constipation, or sleep disturbances, etc.
- You have sudden and unpredictable changes in your symptoms.
- “Off” periods that aren’t controlled by other Parkinson’s medications. This
might include severe movement difficulties first thing in the morning before
the tablet medication kicks in.
- You do not need more than a certain number of injections per day. If more are
needed, a pump may be considered (see below).
- People (or their carers) are able to give themselves injections (after being
trained). If people with Parkinson’s or carers are not able to give injections, an
apomorphine pump may be considered.
A pump may be able to be supported by a district nurse or another nurse.
What should I expect from the assessment process?
Apomorphine injections are a specialised treatment that is only managed by
specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital.
If your Parkinson’s specialist team think it might be a good treatment for you, they
can refer you to a specialist centre. They will usually have a trial of the medication
to see if it helps. This is often done in a planned day visit to hospital. You may be
asked to take an anti-nausea tablet for three days before the trial. The Parkinson’s
nurse or doctor will measure how much medication is needed to improve motor
symptoms in order to select a starting dose.
What does the procedure involve?
You will learn and practice how to use the medication. The specialist centre will
assess that you or a carer are able to use the injectable pens of apomorphine. You
will have a plan for use of the medication going forward.
What are the benefits?
- Apomorphine injections can be a “rescue” treatment. It works quickly and it lasts for
a short time.
It can be taken if tablets haven’t kicked in yet or have worn off.
- Apomorphine can improve quality of life. It can allow some people to keep working or
continue other activities longer.
What are the possible risks or side effects?
Many side effects of apomorphine are typical for dopamine agonists, and should be
discussed with your specialist team:
- Nausea or vomiting o You will likely be given anti-nausea medication to start a few
days before your trial of apomorphine and to continue taking for a short time while
using the medication. • Sleepiness
- Hallucinations
- Problems with blood pressure
- Changes in behaviour known as ‘impulse control disorders’ (see Impulsive
Behaviours)
- Overuse of medication. This can lead to dopamine dysregulation syndrome.
What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?
When you start apomorphine injections you will be given details for who to
contact if there is a problem. This may be a trained community nurse or the team
at the specialist centre. You should carry the details of your treatment and your
specialist team on you to contact if necessary. If you experience side effects,
discuss them with your specialist team as soon as they occur.
Apomorphine pump
What is it?
Apomorphine (a dopamine agonist)
is delivered continuously via a small pump.
The pump has a small needle which is inserted under
the skin. It tends to be given during day time hours
and stopped at night.
Who is it for?
You may be able to have an apomorphine pump if:
- You have problems with involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’).
•
•
- Your tablet medication has stopped working so well. For example, you have
multiple ’off’ periods.
It is not likely to improve people beyond their current best and will not get rid of
all motor symptoms. The goal of this treatment is to improve a person’s ability to
carry out day-to-day tasks. It aims to give people a better quality of life.
What should I expect from the assessment process?
Similar to the apomorphine injection process described above.
What does using an apomorphine pump involve?
A new needle is inserted each day. The medication is delivered through the
needle, a small flexible tube, syringe and pump. The needle is often inserted into
the skin of the tummy or the front of the thigh. Apomorphine is usually infused
through the waking hours at a set rate. The pump is then disconnected at night.
What are the possible benefits?
- Once the pump is on a stable dose and you feel well, it might be possible to reduce
your tablet doses.
- You may experience fewer and less severe “off” periods
- Apomorphine can improve quality of life. It can allow some people to keep working or
continue other activities longer.
What are the possible risks?
The most common risk is skin nodule formation (small lumps under the skin). This
occurs in most people with the pump. Things that may help to prevent this are
excellent hygiene and proper needle insertion and rotation. Lumps may also be
treated using ultrasound. You will also be required to undertake regular blood
checks.
Other possible side effects include:
Many side effects of apomorphine are typical for dopamine agonists, and should be
discussed with your specialist team:
- Nausea and vomiting o You will likely be given anti-nausea medication to start a few
days before your trial of apomorphine and to continue taking for a short time while
using the medication. • Hallucinations
- Sleepiness
- Blood pressure problems
- Changes in behaviour known as ‘impulse control disorders’ (see Impulsive Behaviours)
What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?
When you start apomorphine pump treatment you will be given details for who to
contact if there is a problem. This may be a trained community nurse or the team
at the specialist centre. You should carry the details of your treatment and your
specialist team on you to contact if necessary. If you experience side effects,
discuss them with your specialist team as soon as they occur.
Deep Brain Stimulation
What is it?
Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is used in specific cases to treat tremor or other
movement problems in Parkinson’s. Electrodes which give electrical impulses are
placed in certain areas of the brain. Wires connect the electrodes to a pulse
generator, usually implanted in the chest. This pulse generator runs on battery and
is set up by a specialist to deliver electrical energy to ease symptoms.
DBS is not a cure; it does not slow the progression of Parkinson’s.
Who is it for?
You may be considered for DBS if you:
- are diagnosed with typical or idiopathic Parkinson’s;
- don’t have significant memory or mood problems;
- have specific movement problems (motor fluctuations or dyskinesia) despite
medication changes;
- can travel to the specialist centre that looks after DBS. There will be lifelong follow-
up appointments; and
- have symptoms that get better with levodopa. Symptoms that don’t get better with
levodopa typically don’t improve with DBS.
- See extra information below about some symptoms that don’t tend to get better
with DBS (if they don’t improve with levodopa).
- Speaking problems
•
•
- Swallowing problems
- Some balance problems (loss of postural reflexes)
- ‘Freezing’ that occurs when you are otherwise moving well
- Apathy
- Drooling of saliva
- Constipation
- Sleep disturbances
- Low mood
- Memory or thinking problems.
What should I expect from the assessment process?
Deep Brain Stimulation is a highly specialised treatment that is only done at
specialist centres, which may not be your local hospital. If your Parkinson’s
specialist team think it might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a
specialist centre. Please be aware there are often long waiting times before you get
an appointment. The initial appointment is to see if the specialists think it might be
a good treatment for you and to discuss it with you in more detail.
If they think it could be a good treatment for you, and you wish to proceed, there
will be an assessment process at the specialist centre. This is likely to involve:
- Assessment of your Parkinson’s (‘motor’ and ‘non-motor’ problems), including
memory and thinking.
- Assessment of your response to levodopa.
- Assessment of your suitability for the surgical procedure and the required scans.
- Scans of your brain.
If you have DBS, you will need to have follow-up appointments for many years after
surgery. This is for the purpose of programming and battery checks.
What does the procedure involve?
- This procedure is typically done under local anaesthetic.
- A frame is put around your head, so it stays still.
- MRI scans are done to map out the head and locate the target areas of the brain.
- Two holes are made, and electrodes are carefully placed in the target areas.
- Wires from the electrodes are inserted under the skin. They are not usually
connected to the pulse generator until a period of time after the electrodes are
placed.
- The pulse generator is surgically placed on the chest or stomach area.
- Adjustments to the stimulation of the electrodes tend to be required more
frequently in the first few months after surgery.
- The batteries on the pulse generator will need to be surgically replaced every few
years.
What are the intended benefits?
This depends on the area of the brain that is being stimulated. Mostly, the main
goal is to increase time spent at your best (‘on’ time). As such, it may improve your
ability to carry out day-to-day activities. It is not expected to improve someone
beyond their current best, or get rid of all movement problems.
Other possible benefits:
- May reduce severe involuntary movements (‘dyskinesias’)
- May reduce time when movements are less free (‘off’ time)
- May improve the severity of movements movement problems during ‘off’ time
- May reduce the time when movements are freer but troubled by involuntary
movements (‘on time dyskinesia’).
What are the potential risks?
•
•
There are potential risks related to:
- The surgical procedure. For example, bleeding in the brain or infection of any part
of the device.
- The electrodes. For example, if the electrodes move or stop working.
- The stimulation. Side effects most commonly occur directly after the operation and
often settle down after a few weeks. Other symptoms are longer lasting but may
improve with changes in medication or the stimulation settings. For example, it can
cause:
- Slurred or
slowed speech
- Weight gain o
Apathy
- Difficulty
opening your
eyelids o
Involuntary
movements
(‘dyskinesias’) o
Mood changes
What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?
The specialist centre where you have the surgery continue with your follow-up
care. They will provide you with details of your DBS device and contact details in
case of any problems. You should carry these details of your treatment on you so
that the specialist team can be contacted if there is an emergency.
The settings of your stimulator can be adjusted in order to provide the best result
for you. This will happen in the weeks following your surgery and at follow-up
appointments when the requirements may have changed.
## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“We always came back to the fact that if we’ve tried medication and I still
had problems, there’s the operation. We Googled it and my son found out
about it. I didn’t want to have the operation because I thought it was too
risky. But then it came to a stage where I thought yes, I have to have that. I
had the professor who was really good, and then the Parkinson’s nurse.
They were really helpful and kind of guided me, saying, you know, “Now’s
the time for you to have the surgery because your body is sort of showing
you that it’s not lasting enough on the tablets and then surgery’s an option
if you want to go for it.” Because you think, “Well I went into every avenue
of the pills.” I saw videos of the operation, of the DBS system.
So once I had the operation, you know, I could talk to you now probably
longer than before. And now I’m more able to sort of express myself in an
easy speech. It’s a bit better since I had the stimulator put in. And then the,
doing things without getting tired too much.
Like they said, the operation will manage your symptoms and that’s what
it’s doing. I’m managing my symptoms better than I was without the
operation. They gave me quite a lot of support, the DBS team.” (Person with
Parkinson’s – 03P)
Ultrasound
This method is currently under research for the treatment of tremor. It is not yet available
for use.
Duodopa infusion
What is it?
Duodopa is a gel form of levodopa that is pumped
through a tube into the gut. This is where
levodopa is best absorbed, so the medication is
going directly where it needs to go. You will need
an operation for the tube to be inserted. The tube
passes from outside the body, through the skin,
into the stomach and into the required part of the
gut. The tube stays in place long term. The person
(and/or their carer) will be taught how to look
after it.
A pump is attached to the tube to regulate the amount of medication that goes in.
The medication packet is attached to the pump. The pump is usually worn for 16
hours per day and disconnected for the other 8 hours. In general, the medication
•
•
is delivered continuously for the daytime, but can be paused or extra doses given
if needed. The medication packs are kept in the fridge when they are not on the
pump.
Who is it for?
You may be able to have Duodopa infusion if:
- You are diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have specific difficulties, such as:
- Significant periods where the medication has become less effective, ‘off’ periods.
Disabling involuntary movements, ‘dyskinesias’, at times when the medication is
otherwise working well.
- Your symptoms respond well to levodopa.
Symptoms that don’t get better with levodopa don’t tend to improve with
Duodopa either. These may include problems with speaking, swallowing,
falling due to loss of postural reflexes, or ‘freezing’ when the medication is
otherwise working well (‘on’ periods). These may also include other non-
motor symptoms such as apathy, drooling of saliva, constipation, or sleep
disturbances, etc.
- You (or someone supporting you) are available to accept and immediately refrigerate
deliveries of the medication. You must also have space to store the medication in the
fridge.
Duodopa is not suitable if you have certain problems,
including:
- Significant dementia or significant psychotic symptoms o conditions that
make the surgery higher risk; o problems which would prevent the person
being able to connect and disconnect the pump safely. This does not apply
if there is someone else available to support you.
The goal of this treatment is to have people feel at their best for more of the time.
Duodopa doesn’t make people better than their current best other than
potentially reducing dykinesias.
What should I expect from the assessment process?
Duodopa is a highly specialised treatment that is only managed at specialist
centres, which may not be your local hospital. If your Parkinson’s team think it
might be a good treatment for you, they can refer you to a specialist centre. Please
be aware there are often long waiting times before you get an appointment. The
first appointment is to see if the specialists also think it might be a good treatment
for you and to discuss it with you in more detail.
If they think it might be a good treatment for you, and you wish to proceed, there
will be an assessment process at the specialist centre. This is likely to involve:
- Assessment of your symptoms (‘motor’ and ‘non-motor’), memory and thinking.
- Assessment of your body response to levodopa.
- Assessment of your suitability for the surgery.
- Discussion about how you would manage the medication and care of the tube.
Some centres do the assessments during a planned hospital stay, others do it
through a series of appointments.
What does the procedure involve?
The process may be different in different hospitals. Some hospitals arrange a
planned hospital stay to trial the medication before going ahead. For the trial, the
medication may be given through a temporary tube that is inserted through the
nose, down into the gut. This is called a nasogastric tube.
If the trial goes well, then the long term
‘jejunostomy’ tube is inserted and the nasogastric
tube is removed. The jejunostomy tube is usually
inserted one of two ways:
1. A camera is inserted from the mouth down the food
pipe to guide where the cut should be made for the tube.
2. Special x-rays used to guide placement.
The tube connects from outside the body, through
the skin into the stomach and is extended on the
inside to reach the required part of the gut
(sometimes called PEG-J).
In general, these procedures are done using local anaesthetic injection into the skin
where the cut will be made. Sedating medicine is given via a drip.
•
•
Once the tube is safe to use, tablet medications are reduced down and discontinued as
the Duodopa dose is optimised. Some people still need some tablet medication,
particularly for the night time.
What are the intended benefits?
- Less ‘off’ time, more ‘on’ time
- Less dyskinesia
- Reduced oral medications
- Better quality of life
What are the potential risks?
- Early risks include problems with the procedure, such as pain, site infection, and tube
detachment
- Other risks include problems with the tube, such as blockages, or issues with the skin
around the tube.
- Longer term problems include weight loss and low vitamin B12 levels (this can cause
problems with nerve function)
What do I do if I have a problem afterwards?
You will need long term follow-up at the specialist centre for your Duodopa treatment.
When you have the procedure and are set up with the equipment, you will be
given contact details for who to contact if there are any problems. You should
carry the details of your treatment on you so that the specialist team can be
contacted if there is an emergency.

Complementary Therapies
Complementary therapies are a group of therapies that
have until recently stood outside of usual Western
healthcare. They are becoming increasingly used
together with mainstream medicine. An example would
be using acupuncture as well as the more usual pain-
killing tablets to help lessen discomfort following
surgery.
Complementary therapies are considered different to
Alternative Therapies. Alternative Therapies are generally used instead of
conventional treatments. An example of this might be using homeopathy or herbal
remedies and no conventional medications.
These are not discussed here.
Complementary therapies are generally considered to be holistic. This means they
usually include all aspects of physical, mental and emotional health. This is
because these are all seen as closely connected. For example, a complementary
therapist would look at how a condition affects the whole of someone’s life. They
would not just look at a symptom on its own. This might mean that a therapist
suggests dietary and lifestyle changes as well as offering a physical therapy.
Complementary therapies are often used to boost physical and emotional
wellbeing. Some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of
using them.
What are they?
There are many complementary therapies, and so we cannot provide a complete
list. Many complementary therapies have not had rigorous scientific testing and
we are not able to say whether they work or not. It is not possible to recommend
or endorse any therapy in particular. Different therapies may work for different
people. The following are just some of the better-known complementary therapies
available. You may like to look into these further:
- Acupuncture
- Acupressure
- Alexander technique
- Aromatherapy
