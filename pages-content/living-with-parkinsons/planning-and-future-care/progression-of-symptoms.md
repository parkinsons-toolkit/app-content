# Progression of Symptoms in Parkinson’s
Everyone’s experience of Parkinson’s is different. Just because some people experience the symptoms described here does not mean that you will.

In general, over time people may experience more symptoms, but there is no rule about which symptoms or when. For some, the uncertainty about how things will look and feel in the future is one of the most difficult parts of the Parkinson’s diagnosis.

_Progression_ may involve the development of new symptoms or the worsening of existing symptoms. It may include an increasing difficulty controlling symptoms. Here we discuss challenges around progression and some of the more advanced symptoms. For other symptoms see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages.

## Dealing with Progression

**Types of loss in Parkinson’s:**

- Loss of ability to do things you could before
- Loss of feeling good about yourself as a person

Loss may be:

- Long-term
- Repeated at different stages of the condition

**Grief:**

- A normal emotional response to loss
- Can include feelings such as anger and denial
- Does not necessarily follow distinct “stages”
- Can occur long after you thought you had accepted the situation
- Can also affect family, friends, and carers
- May occur before the loss happens (_anticipatory grief_)

### What Can Be Done

- Acknowledge grief as normal
- Use available support to help you through the grieving process:
  - Talk to people in your life to help them understand your viewpoint
  - Connect with others who have personal experience (support groups: face-to-face or online)
  - Share practical tips and emotional support
- If feelings are overwhelming, speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team

> **My Experience**  
> “The more I said, ‘Parkinson’s is doing this,’ you may be more angry and frustrated. But to be able to think that it’s a disease and I’m living with it and I have to go and change my life around it, you sort of understand that I have to accept that, because it’s not going to go away. It’s going to stay there. So it’s better for me to deal with it like that.” — _Person with Parkinson’s_

## Progression of Symptoms

**Variability is common:**

- Good days and bad days
- Good hours and bad hours
- Impossible to predict exact progression

**General trends over time:**

- Symptoms may be mild for a while with little daily impact
- Symptoms may worsen and/or affect other parts of the body  
  (e.g., a tremor in one hand may spread to the foot)
- Movement symptoms may respond well to medication early on
- Later, medication effects may wear off between doses
- Involuntary movements (e.g., twisting of shoulders) may develop
- Changes in medication or diet may help
- Mobility may decline, increasing falls and freezing
- In advanced stages, fluctuations may become abrupt and unpredictable

### What Can Be Done

- Speak with your Parkinson’s specialist team:
  - Adjust medications or add new ones
  - Consider options such as:
    - Apomorphine injections
    - Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)
    - Intestinal medication delivery via a tube
- If no medical or surgical option helps, adapting to unpredictable symptoms may be necessary
- For daily activity difficulties, request a referral to an Occupational Therapist

> **My Experience**  
> “I did try to keep a diary about the Parkinson’s… because I thought when I go back to the Parkinson’s clinic I could look back and say last week he was like this. It can help see changes, and get help.” — _Carer of someone with Parkinson’s_

## Dementia

**Key points:**

- Not everyone with Parkinson’s develops dementia
- More common after many years, but unpredictable
- “Cognitive impairment” includes difficulties with thinking, concentration, insight, and memory
- Dementia affects multiple areas of thinking and daily life
- Parkinson’s dementia is different from Alzheimer’s or vascular dementia
- Media portrayals of dementia do not always reflect reality, especially in Parkinson’s
- Symptoms vary greatly and may include mood, behaviour, and perception changes
- A diagnosis can trigger grief

### What Can Be Done

- See your GP or Parkinson’s specialist for assessment
- May be referred to a Memory Clinic for evaluation
- Some medications can improve dementia symptoms
- Memory clinics may offer support services or referrals
- Use day-to-day memory strategies (see **Thinking & Remembering** page)
- Prepare for the future by recording wishes or appointing someone to make decisions if you lose capacity (see **Future Care Options** and **Legal Matters**)

## Swallowing Problems & Chest Infections

**Key points:**

- Swallowing problems are common in Parkinson’s
- Range from mild to severe
- Severe swallowing issues may cause food, drink, or saliva to enter the airway (_aspiration_)

> See additional information for more detail on swallowing difficulties and management.

# Swallowing and Aspiration

## How Swallowing Works

- From your **mouth** and **nose**, there are two tubes going down into the body:
  - The **front tube** is for **air** and goes down to the **lungs**.
  - The **back tube** is for **food and drink** and goes down to the **stomach**.
- **When it is all working well**:
  - Your brain and body coordinate movements when you swallow.
  - Food or drink is turned into a **ball (bolus)**.
  - The entry to the air tube is closed.
  - The bolus is pushed down into the stomach.
- **When it is not working well**:
  - This coordination may be lost.
  - Food or drink may go "down the wrong way" into the air tube.

---

## Possible Problems

- **Large solid pieces** going down the wrong way can cause **coughing and choking**.
  - This can be scary, but coughing is the body’s natural reflex to clear the throat — it is a good thing.
- **Smaller solids or liquids** may reach the lungs.
  - Can cause a harmful reaction and sometimes infection called **aspiration pneumonia**.
  - Recurrent debris and reaction can cause **lung scarring**.
- **Pneumonia**: A type of lung infection with symptoms such as:
  - Cough
  - Shortness of breath
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Fever
- **Aspiration**: Food, drink, or saliva going down the wrong way into the airway.

---

## What Can Be Done

- Use **self-help strategies** for mild symptoms (see _Swallowing Difficulties_ page).
- If not already done, or if symptoms have changed, ask your GP for a referral to a **Speech & Language Therapist (SLT)**.
- If food or drink causes coughing, **encourage the cough** to help clear the airway.
- SLTs may recommend:
  - Changes to the **consistency** of food and drink to reduce aspiration risk.
- **Artificial feeding and hydration**:
  - Does not remove the risk of saliva going down the wrong way.
  - Carries risks and may be distressing to insert.
- Some people choose to accept the risk and continue eating/drinking by mouth.
- More information is available on the **Future Care Options** page.
