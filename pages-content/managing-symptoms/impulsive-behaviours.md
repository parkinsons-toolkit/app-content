‘Impulsive’ and ‘compulsive’ behaviours occur when someone has difficulty controlling urges or desires. This means they behave in a way that is out of character or undertake activities that they would not normally do. The individual may not be aware of the problem.

People with impulsive and compulsive behaviours are driven to things that give instant reward. Examples of these behaviours or activities include sexual behaviours, gambling, binge eating and obsessive shopping. Other people may simply spend excessive amounts of time pursuing a hobby or with DIY in a way that interferes with other activities. People may also feel the need to take objects apart, or to continuously hold or handle objects in their hands. Note, the ‘reward’ might not be what you expect. For example, the act of gambling might give the ‘reward’ rather than winning, or the act of shopping rather than the product bought.

**Why does this happen?** The behaviour or activity bring feelings of pleasure. Stopping the behaviour or activity brings feelings of tension and restarting the behaviour or activity relieves that tension. It is normal for behaviour to be driven by ‘rewards’ but disruption to the normal control can lead to impulsive behaviours, like an addiction. Sometimes people may continue to do the behaviour or activity even after the feeling of pleasure or reward they originally felt has gone.

People may also experience a compulsion to take more than their prescribed amount of Parkinson’s medications. They may be addicted to the way it makes them feel. This is called ‘dopamine dysregulation syndrome’. If their healthcare provider tries to reduce it to the amount they are supposed to take, this may cause upset feelings, cravings for the medication, or reduced mobility. Sometimes people will not accept a reduction in medication: they may become aggressive or secretly hoard medications.

Others may not realise they are increasingly taking more medication than the amount their healthcare provider has prescribed. It’s important that family members or carers know your prescribed doses so they can spot if you are taking too much.

The chemical dopamine in the brain is affected in Parkinson’s. Dopamine has many roles, including being involved in the brain control of reward and motivation. Medications that affect dopamine messaging in the brain also affect this control. People with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to develop these impulsive and compulsive behaviours if they are prescribed dopamine agonists (including ropinirole, rotigotine, pramipexole, and bromocriptine). These impulsive behaviours can also occur when taking levodopa. These behaviours may develop at any time during Parkinson’s disease, even if people have been on these medications for a long time.

People may also be more likely to develop these behaviours if they are younger at the age of diagnosis or have a history of alcoholism or addictive behaviours in their families. It appears to affect men more than women.

## What should I do about it?

- It is important that people with Parkinson’s, loved ones and carers are aware of the possibility of these behaviours.
- **You should report any unusual or impulsive behaviours to a specialist as soon as they are noticed.**
- That’s because the best way to treat these behaviours is with careful medication adjustments or changes.

## What can I try for myself?

**Speak to your specialist:**

- The most effective management is speaking to your specialist, who can make changes to your medications or adjust your dosages.

**Monitor for potential problems:**

- People with impulsive or compulsive behaviours may not recognize the problem. It is therefore a good idea to let others whom you trust know that this can occur so they can watch out for signs of this problem.
- Signs may be: weight gain from suspected binge eating, increased spending habits or borrowing money, increased sexual behaviours or other unusual behaviours.
- Some people find it helpful to share their bank statements with a trusted friend or relative to watch out for unusual spending.

**Reducing risk:**

- For people who have had problems with impulsive behaviours, some strategies might be helpful alongside the medication changes:
  - Some people find it helpful to block certain websites (e.g. pornography, internet shopping, gambling sites).
  - Some people find it helpful to give credit/debit cards to a trusted friend or relative for safekeeping or to restrict the amount they can spend.
  - Ensuring that you only have access to the medications you need to take on a given day can prevent you from taking too much medication.

**Look after your mental wellbeing:**

- Stress, anxiety and depression can make impulsive and compulsive behaviour changes worse.

## Further Treatments

- It’s important to treat any depression, because low mood can make any compulsive or impulsive behaviours worse. Treating the depression may make the behaviours better.
- Psychological or talking treatments may also be helpful for some people to help with the impulsive behaviours or associated problems.

### Medication

- Your specialist can adjust or change your Parkinson’s or other medications carefully in order to decrease the compulsive behaviours.
- They may also refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist for further support or treatment.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional. **

## Key Messages

- Impulsive and compulsive behaviours can cause someone to act in a way that is out of character for them.
- Affected individuals may not have insight to see that the activities are causing a problem in their life.
- While these may be difficult topics to raise with your specialist, they are side effects of medication, and your specialist will be aware of them. It’s best to share concerns early, before little problems become big.
- The best treatment for impulsive and compulsive behaviours are medication adjustments or changes, made by your specialist.
