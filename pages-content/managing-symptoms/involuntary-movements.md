# Involuntary Movements (Dyskinesia)

‘Dyskinesias’ are typically quick muscle movements that you cannot control. These movements include wriggling, writhing, twisting, head bobbing, or swaying motions. They can affect one part of the body (e.g. the trunk), arms or legs, or the whole body.

Some people experience dyskinesia when their medications are at the highest levels in the body. Others have dyskinesia when their medications are at the lowest levels in the body (i.e. just before or just after taking medication).

Dyskinesias can range in severity, from some people having it so mildly that they do not notice the movements to others who have severe dyskinesias. Many people with Parkinson’s say their dyskinesias do not bother them, and they would prefer to feel more “on” with dyskinesias and be able to do more, than have fewer dyskinesias but feel more “off” and not be able to do as much.

## What might be causing it?

The exact cause of dyskinesia isn’t known. Experts think it's related to the natural progression of Parkinson’s and the brain becoming more sensitive to dopamine.

It is more common for dyskinesia to develop after a few years of levodopa treatment, but some develop them earlier and others never develop dyskinesias.

Dyskinesia tends to get worse when stressed or anxious.

## What should I do about it?

If dyskinesias aren’t bothering you or impacting on your daily life, then there's nothing you need to do.

If there are lots of extra movements, this can burn extra calories and cause unintended weight loss (see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/weight" class="internal-link">_Weight_</a> page for more information).

There are some ideas below for how to manage your dyskinesia. But if they are impacting your daily life or bothering you, discuss them with your Parkinson’s specialist team.

## What can I try for myself?

### Managing Stress

- Like many Parkinson’s symptoms, dyskinesias are worse when stressed. Finding ways to stay relaxed can be helpful.
- Massage, tai chi, yoga and deep breathing exercises may be helpful tools in managing stress.

### Let your body guide you

If you notice particular times when your movements are good (e.g. feeling “on”) and you don’t have extra movements, make the most of these times to do things you enjoy.

### Explain to others

You can explain to others that the extra movements are part of your Parkinson’s and nothing to be concerned about.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “It can be brought on by all sorts of different things and can cause falls and the like. If we go out, we try and plan it so that we go out at what is likely to be the best window of opportunity with the medication. If we leave it too long, then [dyskinesia] problems occur.”

## Further assessments

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- When does the dyskinesia happen?
  - Before you take your medication (and how long before)?
  - After you take your medication (and how long after you take your medication)?
  - Do they happen in between doses of medication (how much time has passed between doses?)
- How many hours per day do you think you are having dyskinesias?
- Does it bother you? What is the impact of the dyskinesia?
- Have you noticed weight loss?
- Does dyskinesia cause you balance problems or falls?
- Have you sustained any injuries related to the extra movements?

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For 3-5 days you could monitor your dyskinesias and when you take your medication. This will help you to notice any patterns in your dyskinesias.

## Further treatments

A healthcare professional may be able to offer support, advice, or further treatment. They may suggest a change in your treatment if the dyskinesias are severe or bothering you.

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication if it’s within their expertise.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- Changes to medication to control dyskinesia would most likely be made by your Parkinson’s specialist team.

**Changes they might recommend:**

- They may _**change the dose**_ of your antiparkinsonian medications, as lowering doses can sometime reduce dyskinesias (or occasionally increasing it).
- They may change the _**timing**_ of your medication:
  - Splitting the entire daily dose of levodopa into smaller, more frequent doses may be helpful for managing dyskinesia.
- They may _**change**_ which medication you take:
  - For example, changing from one antiparkinsonian treatment to another.
  - Stopping or starting a long-acting antiparkinsonian medication.
  - They may _**add**_ medications to your current regimen, for example adding one of the following medications:
    - Amantadine
    - Dopamine agonist (e.g. ropinirole, or rotigotine)
    - COMT inhibitor (e.g. entacapone)
    - MAO-B inhibitor (e.g. safinamide)

### Referral

- You may be referred on to another service. There is usually a waiting time before that next service will see you.
- If dyskinesia is impacting on your daily activities, your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team may refer you to an occupational therapist. An occupational therapist can help assess whether you'd benefit from additional equipment or support.
- In severe cases where medication is not helping, more advanced therapies may be considered. This often involves a referral to a specialist centre for an assessment. These therapies include:
  - Apomorphine – continuous infusion of medication under the skin
  - Intraduodenal levodopa – continuous infusion of gel form levodopa via the intestine
  - Deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery

## Key Messages

- Dyskinesias are involuntary muscle movements that include swaying, twisting, bobbing, or swaying motions.
- Dyskinesias may happen right before, right after, or between medication doses and the treatment differs for each.
- Changes to medication type and schedule are common management strategies for dyskinesia.
