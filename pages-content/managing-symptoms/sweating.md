# Sweating Difficulties

Sweating is a normal process that helps your body regulate temperature. Some people with Parkinson’s may experience problems with sweating, which can present as either **too much sweat (hyperhidrosis)** or **too little sweat (hypohidrosis)**. Insufficient sweating can lead to overheating. Because Parkinson’s can also reduce the sense of smell, body odours from excessive sweating may go unnoticed.

## What Might Be Causing It?

Sweating is controlled by the **autonomic nervous system**, which can be affected by Parkinson’s.

### Sweating Too Much (Hyperhidrosis)

This can happen in Parkinson’s in situations such as:

- When Parkinson’s medications are starting to wear off  
- Overnight while sleeping (drenching night sweats)  
- When medications are working at their best, especially if dyskinesias (uncontrollable movements) occur  
- As a side effect of Parkinson’s medications  

Other non-Parkinson’s causes include:

- **Primary hyperhidrosis:** Lifelong excess sweating with no obvious cause; can affect the whole body or specific areas (armpits, hands, feet, face) and may run in families  
- **Menopause**  
- **Anxiety**  
- **Medical conditions:** Diabetes, obesity, heart disease, thyroid disease, infections  
- **Side effects of certain medications and supplements**

### Sweating Too Little (Hypohidrosis)

Can occur due to:

- Parkinson’s itself  
- Side effects of medications  

Signs may include:

- Overheating in hot environments (saunas, hot tubs, extreme heat)  
- Reduced sweating in hands and feet, sometimes with compensatory sweating in other areas

## What Should I Do About It?

Excessive sweating can be challenging. If lifestyle strategies do not help after about a month, speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. Seek urgent help if you are not sweating and feel faint or dizzy in warm conditions.

## Self-Help Strategies

### Sweating Too Much

- Identify and avoid triggers (spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine)  
- Use **antiperspirants** (stop sweat) rather than deodorants (stop odor)  
- Avoid nylon or non-breathable clothing  
- Wear black or white clothes to minimize visible sweat  
- Use dress shields/armpit pads  
- Wear cotton or natural fibre socks, and change them frequently  
- Consider moisture-absorbing soles or sports socks  
- Wear leather shoes and change or remove them often  
- Drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration  

### Sweating Too Little

- Avoid very hot environments (hot tubs, saunas, direct sun)  
- Wear light clothing  
- Avoid overexertion during exercise

## Further Assessment

### Questions Healthcare Professionals May Ask

- When sweating problems occur  
- Triggers and related symptoms (weight changes, bowel changes, pain, infections)  
- History of fainting  
- Medication timing and changes tried  

**Tip:** Track symptoms for 3 days in a health diary, noting activity, medication, and other symptoms.

### Tests

- Non-Parkinson’s causes may be investigated, e.g., thyroid hormone tests

## Further Treatments

### Medication

- No tablet directly treats sweating issues, but medication adjustments may help  
- **Medications contributing to excessive sweating:**  
  - Levodopa  
  - Zinc supplements  
  - Some antidepressants (SSRIs, tricyclics like nortriptyline)  
  - Cholinesterase inhibitors (for memory)  
  - Some opioids  
- **Medications contributing to decreased sweating:**  
  - Anticholinergics (oxybutynin, solifenacin, tolterodine, trihexyphenidyl)  
  - Some tricyclic antidepressants  
  - Some glaucoma medications (carbonic anhydrase inhibitors)  
- Dyskinesia-triggered sweating may be improved by adjusting Parkinson’s medication  
- Medication changes during hot weather may help  

### Referral

- Severe sweating not improved with medication or lifestyle changes may require referral to a **dermatologist**  
- Treatments may include:  
  - **Iontophoresis:** Blocks sweat glands using a weak electric current  
  - **Botox (botulinum toxin) injections:** Temporary reduction of sweating; may require repeat treatments

## Key Messages

- People with Parkinson’s may experience **too much or too little sweat**  
- Management mostly involves **lifestyle adjustments** and **review of medications**
