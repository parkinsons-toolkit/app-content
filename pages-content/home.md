**Tip:** if there is something specific you are looking for and can’t find it, use the search box to type what you are looking for e.g., Medication. When you find the page, press **Crtl + F**. This will open a new search box where you can type the words you are looking for e.g. side effects.

### 2. **Personalised Pages**

These are personal to you. They help you record symptoms, set goals, keep track of your health.

In the personalised section you will find:

<div class="action-box">
