## What’s the difference between low mood and depression?

Everyone has times when their mood is low, and they feel unhappy about life. This can happen following a difficult event or experience. It is also possible to feel down without there being a clear reason. For some people, these periods of low mood are manageable and gradually pass. For others, low mood may persist for a long time and can affect their day-to-day life. They may find it more difficult to ‘shake it off’, even for a short time. This may indicate depression. When a person is depressed, it can affect their physical health, their appetite, and their sleep. In the same way, when a person is physically unwell it can lower their mood.

A general low mood may involve feeling sad, but it can also involve feeling emotionally ‘flat’ or ‘empty’. When a person has low mood, they can also experience some of the following:

- Lack of self-confidence
- Feeling worried or anxious
- Feeling frustrated or irritable
- Feeling tired or lacking energy

Just because such feelings are common, it does not mean that they have to be accepted as inevitable. Making small changes in your life, such as talking about a difficult situation or increasing the amount sleep you get, can help to improve your mood. It can also help to keep as physically, mentally, and socially active as you can.

A low mood which persists despite taking positive steps to help manage it can be a sign of depression. Depression is more intense and longer lasting than the short periods of low mood that anyone can experience from time to time. Depression can have the same features as low mood, plus others.

- Low, flat or empty mood lasting 2 weeks or more
- No longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to
- Feeling hopeless
- Feeling tired or lacking energy
- Difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)
- Comfort eating or losing your appetite
- Sleeping more than usual or being unable to sleep

People may feel ‘tired of life’ and that it is not worth living, but not actually want to die. Occasionally, people with more severe depression may have thoughts of harming themselves or taking their own life.

## What might be causing it?

Depression does not have a single cause. It is a result of a combination of physical changes in the brain and the body, a person’s past and current life experiences, and the ways in which they try to cope with them. People with Parkinson’s with depression have often had periods of depression earlier in their life. They may also have family members who are prone to depression.

In Parkinson’s, the chemical changes in the brain can contribute to depression but may not directly cause it. While many people with Parkinson’s experience depression at some time, others do not despite similar brain changes.

There is no evidence that drugs to treat Parkinson’s cause depression, but they also do not seem to help very much. When someone has their Parkinson’s medication changed, they may notice a change in their mood, at least at the start. The changing nature of Parkinson’s symptoms throughout the day can also mean you experience ups and downs in mood, which aren’t always a sign of depression.

Depression can be difficult to diagnose in someone with Parkinson’s. This is because there can be an overlap of symptoms. For example, many people with Parkinson’s experience difficulties with sleeping. These difficulties are likely to make you feel tired and lacking in energy. They therefore do not necessarily mean you’re depressed. Also, changes in facial movements in Parkinson’s can affect facial expression which can be misunderstood. For example, someone may look sad when they are not.

Depression is more common in people who have many different long-term health conditions, not just Parkinson’s. Depression can also be caused by other common conditions not related to Parkinson’s, such as arthritis, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. This tells us that having any long-term health condition may be the most important factor causing depression.

## What should I do about it?

There are many things you can try to help you deal with low mood or depression (see below ‘What can I try for myself?’). At times, feelings of low mood are completely normal. But, if you have these feelings for most of the day, every day for more than 2 weeks, you should make an appointment with your GP. Your GP can assess whether your symptoms suggest that you are depressed. Depending on the outcome, they may recommend medication or a talking therapy (see the <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies
/complementary-therapies" class="internal-link">_Complementary Therapies_</a>) page.

In some situations, depression can need urgent attention. This may be if you are experiencing any of the following:

- Great emotional distress
- Repeated thoughts of death or suicidal ideas
- Thoughts of self-harm or harming others

If you or a family member feels there is an immediate risk, you should go to your nearest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. There will be a trained mental health care professional available that you can see. If you cannot get to A&E yourself, you or someone else can call 999 and ask for an ambulance.

If you need immediate help but don’t want to go to A&E, you could:

- Call Samaritans on Freephone 116 123 – they're open 24 hours a day and are there to listen
- Contact your GP and ask for an emergency appointment
- Contact NHS 111 (England) or NHS Direct 0845 46 47 (Wales)
- Contact your local crisis team (CRHT), if you’re under their care.

## What can I try for myself?

There are many things you can do that may help to improve your mood. Not all of them help everyone, but they are all worth trying. In most cases, they are important for our health and well- being, not just as a way to manage low mood or depression.

### Activity

Exercising regularly can help boost your mood as well as help you sleep. You may choose to do this by taking regular walks, going to the gym, joining a sports team, going to classes for dance, yoga or tai chi. They can also be a source of relaxation and a chance to see other people. But achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as making small changes to your everyday routines. For example:

- Tidy up a bit faster when doing the housework
- Use the stairs instead of the lift or escalator
- Leave the car at home for short journeys
- Get off the bus a stop earlier and walk the rest of the journey
- See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing
  /keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> for more guidance.

If you have any concerns about safe and suitable exercise routines, discuss with your GP or a physiotherapist who will be able to recommend exercise that is right for you.

### Diet

Maintaining a healthy, balanced diet is important for everyone. The food you eat can affect the way you feel, both physically and mentally, and how you feel can affect the food you eat. So, healthy eating habits can improve your mood and general sense of wellbeing.

For example, people who are depressed can often crave ‘junk food’ that is high in sugar and salt. These foods can briefly lift our mood but can lead to highs and lows in our blood glucose. We might also feel guilty for over-eating this type of food. This can cause our mood to fluctuate and leave us feeling irritable and tired. On the other hand, some people who are depressed may not feel like eating and are at risk of becoming underweight.

It can be beneficial to limit your alcohol intake. Drinking alcohol frequently can lead to depression as it lowers your mood (it has a depressant effect on mood). Alcohol also affects sleep. While alcohol can initially make you feel more sleepy, it affects your sleep quality. If you drink alcohol before going to bed you are less likely to have a refreshing night’s sleep.

See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing
/eating-well" class="internal-link">_Eating Well_</a> page for more guidance.

### Keeping socially active and combat loneliness

When a person is depressed, they often cut themselves off from other people. Even when not depressed, many people can feel isolated and lonely. This can make depression more likely.

Socialising can improve your mood. Staying in contact with friends and family means you have someone to talk to when you feel low. Talking to others with Parkinson’s can also help by sharing your experiences and learning about different coping mechanisms or solutions to similar problems.

Look out for new opportunities from activities offered through local colleges, places of worship (e.g. churches, mosques, temples), community centres, leisure facilities, charities and societies (e.g. your local U3A group). Your local library can be a good source of information about what is available in your area. We have listed some other possible sources in our _Practical Advice_ pages which you can within the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons" class="internal-link">_Living with Parkinson's_</a> section. If you need support speicifally with travelling to events, see our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/travel" class="internal-link">_Travel_</a> page for advice.

Visit our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing
/social-and-spiritual-life" class="internal-link">_Social & Spiritual Life_</a> page for more information on how you can keep socially active.

### Sleep

Depression and anxiety can both affect the quality of our sleep. Similarly, when our sleep is disturbed by other things it can negatively affect our mood. Improving your sleep is one of the best ways to manage low mood and depression. There are a few things you can try to help improve the amount and quality of your sleep:

- Have a strict bed time routine, going to bed at the same time each night.
- Leave yourself time to wind down before bed (e.g. avoid using electronic devices for at least an hour before you go to bed as these may have a negative effect on sleep).
- Try to relax before going to bed (e.g. reading, a warm bath, gentle music, relaxation or stretching exercises).
- Write a “to do” list for the next day before bed can help to clear your mind of any distractions.
- Make sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable.
- Try to avoid caffeine (e.g. tea and coffee) after 2pm.

See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/sleep" class="internal-link"></a> p_Sleep_age for more tips on how to improve the amount and quality of your sleep.

### Relaxation and Breathing Exercises

It’s important to try and make time to relax. Try doing things you find restful, such as listening to music, reading a book, going for a walk, or getting creative by painting or colouring. See the _Mind_ charity website, along with other useful resources, linked at the bottom of this page, for more tips on how to incorporate relaxation into your daily life.

It can also help to practise calming breathing techniques. This can reduce any stress and boost your emotional well-being. See our (see <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/dealing-with-stress-and-challenges" class="internal-link">_Dealing with Stress and Challenges_</a> page for a simple breathing exercise you can try.

### Mindfulness

Mindfulness encourages you to pay closer attention to the present moment, focusing on your thoughts, feelings, bodily sensations and your environment. Doing this regularly can help to improve your general emotional wellbeing.

Mindfulness is often included as part of psychological treatment. It is recommended by the National Institute of Care Excellence (NICE) as a way to help prevent the recurrence of depression in people that have had several episodes over their lifetime. Mindfulness groups and courses are available in some areas. The <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/drugs-and-treatments/mindfulness/how-to-learn-mindfulness/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mind</a> website gives more information on these and other ways to learn Mindfulness. Visit the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Mental Health & Wellbeing</a> pages for more information on how mindfulness can help mental wellbeing. It also gives guidance on how we can incorporate mindfulness into our day-to-day lives. You can find links in our More Information section below.

### Keep a Gratitude Diary

Keeping a diary of the things you’re grateful for may lift your mood have a positive effect on your mental wellbeing. Try to describe one thing you’re grateful for and do this twice a week. You can write about anything that comes to mind, as long as it makes you feel grateful. For example, it could be something very little that has happened or a person that you’re grateful for.

_Tips for keeping a gratitude diary..._

- Take time to think about something that you’re truly grateful for.
- Writing about people you’re grateful for tends to have more of a positive effect than writing about things or events.
- Try to include as much detail as possible about _why_ you’re grateful.
- Plan a time when you will write in your diary. Consider setting an alarm on your phone if you find that you are forgetting to write your diary entries

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/diary.jpg" alt="gratitude-diary" class="low-mood__diary">

### Complementary Therapies

Complementary therapies include massage, acupuncture and aromatherapy. These therapies have not been tested in clinical trials, but some people with Parkinson’s report having positive experiences of them. These therapies may not directly treat the depression but can be helpful for relaxation and general wellbeing.

Check with your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse if you wish to take anything by mouth or apply it to your skin as a complementary therapy.

See our <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies
/complementary-therapies" class="internal-link">_Complementary Therapies_</a> page for more information.

### Resources for Wellbeing and Mental Health

There are also lots of apps for your computer, smart phone or tablet which aim to help with anything from managing general wellbeing to targeting more specific health concerns. Most of them have not been tested. If you want to try one, the NHS link to recommended apps throughout the NHS website.

There are also many books that might be helpful. The <a href="https://reading-well.org.uk/books/books-on-prescription" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reading Well Books on Prescription</a> website has some ideas. Many of these books will be available through your local library. You can find the link in our More Information section below.

### Self-Help Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT)

Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) focuses on how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour all influence each other. In turn, this can lead to or worsen feelings of depression (see below the ‘Further treatments’ section of this page for more information). There are a number of self-help CBT books recommended by the NHS for people with depression. You can access many of these at your local library via the ‘Books on Prescription’ scheme. For more information, speak with your GP or Parkinson’s nurse. Or, visit the <a href="https://reading-well.org.uk/books/books-on-prescription" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> website.

## My Experience

> “Sometimes I do have a good old moan and I do have a bit of a cry, because I feel so frustrated when I can’t do what I want to do. But then I just have to pick myself up and get going again.”
>
> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

> “I can have a bad day, I can have days when my mood swings are not very happy because I don’t feel very well. When I’m not well, I’m obviously not happy. That’s why watching a film sometimes helps because you’re into the film. And you can ignore the fact of how you’re probably feeling. I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.”

> _(Person with Parkinson’s)_

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They might ask about:**

- How often you are affected by low mood and how long does it last?
- How is low mood affecting your life?
- Are you no longer getting enjoyment from the things you used to?
- Are you feeling hopeless?
- Are you feeling tired or lacking energy?
- Are you having difficulty concentrating on everyday things (e.g. watching the television)?
- Are you comfort eating or losing your appetite?
- Are you sleeping more than usual or unable to sleep?
- Are you having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of self-harm?
- Do you sometimes see or hear things that are not really there? Do you have any other unusual experiences?

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- If your mood fluctuates during the day, track it over 2-3 days to see when it bothers you most. You could also record your sleep patterns if these vary. You could note any factors that you think may be related (i.e. things that seem to make your mood worse and things that seem to help). Also record when you take your medication as there may be a relationship.

### Tests

Depending on their assessment, your healthcare professional may wish to examine you and carry out blood or urine tests. Such tests are used to look for other causes of depression, such as thyroid conditions or imbalances in the blood (e.g. high calcium levels).

## Further Treatments

Your healthcare professional may be able to give you more specific advice about things you could try yourself. They might also refer you on to another service or discuss the option of medication.

### Referral

- Referral would typically be for talking therapies or to mental health teams. Your GP can refer you, and it may also be available through your specialist team. In England you can also self-refer for talking therapies without going through your GP through this <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service- search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS page</a>. There can be a long wait to start therapy on the NHS.
- Talking therapies offer a safe, confidential place to talk to a trained professional about any difficulties you are having:
  - Therapy sessions can be one-to-one with the therapist or in small groups.
  - There is lots of different types of talking therapies, but they all have the same aim of improving your wellbeing.

### Examples of types of talking therapies

- **Counselling:** Counselling can help you cope with mild versions of common mental health problems, including depression. It might also help you to talk about a specific event or cause for your low mood, such as relationship difficulties or a bereavement. Counselling may be available on the NHS. It can also be available for free through your employer. Some charities offer cheap or free talking therapies or group support. This includes <a href="https://www.cruse.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruse</a> for bereavement care, <a href="https://www.relate.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Relate</a> for relationship counselling and <a href="https://www.mind.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mind</a>. Some private counsellors also offer discounted rates for those on low incomes. See our More information section for details on how to find a trained and accredited therapist.
- **Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT):** CBT aims to help you understand how your feelings, thoughts, and behaviour influence each other. Your therapist will aim to teach you skills in identifying and overcoming ‘unhelpful’ or negative thoughts to help you cope better and reduce symptoms of depression. CBT typically involves a course of weekly sessions and may be delivered by a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or specially trained nurse. For people with milder depression, treatment can be done via computer from your own home with support from a mental health care professional. CBT for depression will include looking to help associated problems such as sleep, lack of physical activity, and social isolation. CBT is available on the NHS by <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/service-search/find-a-psychological-therapies-service/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">self-referral</a> or through your GP.
- **Other therapies:** While CBT is the most commonly offered therapy, other therapies might also be available and recommended. A wide range of other therapies exist. The <a href="https://www.bacp.co.uk/about-therapy/types-of-therapy/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy (BACP)</a> has an A-Z of therapies, which explains what they are. You can talk to your GP or NHS psychological therapy service about other types of therapy available in your area.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/talking-therapy.jpg" alt="talking-therapy" class="low-mood__talking-therapy">

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**

**Medication used for low mood:**

- **Antidepressants:** For moderate to severe depression, antidepressant medication may be prescribed alone or recommended in combination with talking therapy. ‘Combination Therapy’ of antidepressant medication with talking therapy can result in better outcomes than just receiving one of these treatments. Research has not yet identified a specific type of anti-depressant to recommend specifically for people with Parkinson’s. There is some evidence for tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline. There is limited evidence for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram or sertraline in Parkinson’s specifically. There is good evidence however that they can work for moderate or severe depression in the general population. While some antidepressants work very well for some people they have no effect for others. Usually, a person is tried on one medicine at increasing doses for several weeks to see if it helps. If it does not, then the drug should be slowly withdrawn and a different drug tried. Anti-depressants are not addictive, but they should not be stopped suddenly. If none of the main drugs seem to help, your GP may refer you to a specialist for further advice. You can read more about different anti-depressant drugs and potential side effects on the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/antidepressants/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS 'Antidepressants'</a> page.
- **Parkinson’s medicines:** There is some research evidence for the dopamine agonist pramipexole, but the effects are modest. Other Parkinson’s drugs have no obvious antidepressant effect.
- **St John’s wort:** St John’s wort is a herbal treatment that some people take for mild-moderate depression. It is not recommended by doctors and should never be combined with prescribed antidepressants. In particular, <ins>it should not be taken by people with Parkinson’s</ins> as it can interact with a lot of medication, including Parkinson’s medication. It is important you let your healthcare professionals know if you are taking this.

**Medications that can make your mood worse:**
If you are depressed and taking any of these, you should not stop them without speaking with your GP for advice.

- Benzodiazepines, e.g. diazepam
- Pain killers: opiates
- Steroid medication, e.g. prednisolone
- Beta blockers, e.g. bisoprolol, propranolol
- Hormonal medicine, e.g. some Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) used for menopausal symptoms or hormonal contraceptive medicines.
