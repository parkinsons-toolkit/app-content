# Dealing with Stress and Challenges

Stress can often make symptoms such as tremor worse. Learning how to cope with stressful life events can help you to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life.

Even when emotionally and mentally healthy, you may still experience negative emotions — these are part of normal life. Having good emotional health means developing the ability to bounce back from difficult situations.

Below are some suggestions to promote emotional wellbeing and help you feel more in control when dealing with stress. When you have read them through, spend some time thinking about how you might incorporate some of the tips into your routine.

## What can I do?

### Activity

Being more active can help to combat stress. For some people, Parkinson’s makes it tricky to stay active. You may have to adapt the type of activity you do. Some may choose to go to the gym or join a sports team; others may need something they can do at home. One effect of the COVID pandemic has been a considerable increase in the amount and range of exercise classes available online, through platforms such as Zoom.

Achieving a more active lifestyle can be as simple as making small changes to your everyday routines, for example:

- Tidying up a bit faster when doing the housework
- Walk one or two flights of stairs if possible and then take the lift
- Leaving the car at home for short journeys
- Getting off the bus a stop earlier and walking the rest of the journey
- Put things you commonly use on a higher shelf so you have to stretch to reach them

See our *Keeping Active* page for more guidance or visit Parkinson’s UK and see their [exercise page](https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/information-and-support/exercise) for more advice.

### Diet

The food we eat can affect the way we feel, both physically and mentally. And in turn, how we feel can affect the food we eat. So, healthy eating habits are important for improving our mood and general sense of wellbeing.

Research recommends the following advice for a healthy, balanced diet:

- Eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day (e.g., try adding an extra portion of vegetables to your dinner or add a fruit snack into your day)
- Eat healthy portions of food
- Eat the right balance of food groups (carbohydrates, dairy, meat, fish, etc.)
- Eat regular meals (e.g., breakfast, lunch, and dinner)
- Drink plenty of fluids (at least 6–8 glasses a day)

See *Eating Well* for more guidance.

### Sleep

Getting good-quality sleep is vital for our mental wellbeing. There are a few things you can try to help improve the amount and quality of your sleep, including:

- Going to bed at the same time each night
- Leaving yourself time to wind down before bed (e.g., avoid using electronic devices for an hour before you go to bed)
- Writing a “to-do” list for the next day before bed to clear your mind of distractions
- Making sure your bedroom is dark, quiet, and comfortable

**Tip:** Some people find it helpful to write down exactly what they do each night before bed. That can raise awareness of your evening routines and help you think about how to improve your sleep.

If you are experiencing sleep disturbance, see the *Symptom Management* pages.

### Relaxation

Doing something relaxing can help to reduce stress and improve your mental wellbeing. Although life can be busy, it is important to try to do things you enjoy. This might include:

- Listening to music
- Reading a book
- Going for a walk
- Getting creative (painting, colouring, etc.)

Try to carve out a regular time in your daily routine for relaxation activities. See the [Mind website](https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/tips-for-everyday-living/relaxation/relaxation-tips) for tips and exercises.

### Breathing Strategies

Practising breathing techniques can help you breathe more deeply and feel calmer.

Here’s a simple breathing exercise (takes less than 5 minutes):

1. Get into a comfortable position (standing, sitting, or lying).
2. Try to keep your shoulders down and relaxed. Place your hand on your stomach.
3. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Feel your stomach rise and fall.
4. Count steadily: e.g., “one, two, three, four, five” while breathing in and the same while breathing out.
5. Repeat for 3–5 minutes.

### Complementary Therapies

Complementary therapies (e.g., reflexology, aromatherapy, or massage) are used alongside other treatments. Some people with Parkinson’s find them relaxing, and report improved sleep and reduced anxiety.

> ⚠️ Some complementary therapies involve substances that may interact with medications. Always consult your GP, specialist, or Parkinson’s nurse before use.

See our *Complementary Therapy* page for more info.

### Problem-Solving Therapy (PST)

Problem Solving Therapy helps you cope with stressful life events by teaching structured problem-solving skills.

#### 1. Choosing a problem

- Must be changeable and clearly defined:
  - Vague: “I’m anxious”
  - Specific: “I feel anxious in the evenings and struggle to sleep”

#### 2. Pursuing an idea

- Create an achievable idea to help solve the problem:
  - E.g., “I will fit in 20 minutes of breathing exercises into my evening routine”

#### 3. Planning ahead and foreseeing barriers

- Break the idea into steps and anticipate barriers:
  - **Step:** At 9pm each night, I will do breathing exercises from the *Living with Parkinson’s* toolkit
  - **Barriers:** I forget or feel I don’t have time
  - **Overcome:** Set a reminder, pair with brushing teeth, ask partner to remind

#### 4. Reflect afterward

- Did the steps help solve the problem?
- If not, consider:
  - Are steps clear?
  - Are they realistic?
  - Did unexpected issues arise?

The goal of PST is not to solve *every* problem, but to build confidence in your problem-solving abilities.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:

> “Sometimes I find if things get too stressful for me or I’m having a bad day I get a colouring book – you know those adult ones? Or people do word searches, write down their thoughts or go for a walk; just different ways people can deal with if they’re having a bad day or.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*

> “When you sit there with Parkinson’s, you think, ‘I can’t do that, I can’t do this, I can’t go here, I can’t go there. I can’t eat this,’ what about all the things you *can* do, you forget. I don’t dwell on the bad stuff, and the good stuff sometimes takes my mind away from the bad stuff. I can manage it a little bit better.”
