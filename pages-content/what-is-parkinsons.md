Parkinson’s is a chronic condition that causes difficulties with movements. It can also cause a range of other symptoms. Parkinson’s is an extremely varied condition. It affects each person uniquely. Different symptoms may occur at different times. Each symptom may respond differently to treatments.

_Parkinsonism_ is a broad term. It covers a range of conditions that have features similar to Parkinson's. When speaking about Parkinson’s, people are usually referring to Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease. This is one type of Parkinsonism, but there are a number of others.

## What is the cause?

In Parkinson’s there is a gradual loss of cells. This is mainly in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra. These cells produce a chemical messenger called **dopamine**. As less dopamine is available over time, people start experiencing problems with their movements. Dopamine is known as a <ins>neurotransmitter</ins>. Other neurotransmitters are also believed to decrease. This decrease may be responsible for other symptoms of Parkinson’s.

At present, no one knows for sure what causes Parkinson’s. Many factors are associated with an increased or decreased chance of having it. Research continues in this area. We know there is a genetic component, but with rare exceptions it is not due a single gene, inherited from one generation to the next. More often, a combination of many genes is thought to be involved.

## Myth Buster

“Parkinson’s only affects old people.” - It is most common in people over the age of 60. But it can also occur in younger people.

“Parkinson’s is contagious.” - It is not contagious. You <ins>cannot</ins> catch it from another person.

## How common is Parkinson’s?

Rates of Parkinson’s increase with increasing age.

It affects one person in every 100 people over the age of 60yrs. Parkinson’s affects one person in every 20 people over the age of 80yrs.

## What are the symptoms?

Symptoms of Parkinson’s are often put in groups. These are: movement or motor symptoms; and non-movement or non-motor symptoms.

The three main motor symptoms of Parkinson’s are:

- Slowness of movement, known medically as bradykinesia
- Shaking, known medically as tremor
- Stiffness, known medically as rigidity

Not everyone with Parkinson’s will experience all three main motor symptoms. But movement is always affected for a diagnosis of Parkinson’s. The non-motor symptoms are varied and can be harder to see. Some examples include anxiety, sleep difficulties and constipation. These can occur before movement symptoms. You can read more about specific symptoms on the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symptoms_</a> pages.

## How is Parkinson’s diagnosed?

The diagnosis of Parkinson’s is made by a clinician experienced in Parkinson’s. They ask careful questions and do a close clinical exam. The diagnosis is based on a person’s story and examination. There is no one test that can diagnose Parkinson’s. Doctors may order brain scans like an _MRI_, or order some blood tests to exclude other conditions. These actions can add pieces to the puzzle. Sometimes Parkinson’s can look like other conditions. It may even look like a normal ageing process. The diagnosis is not always clear. Since there is no test to show whether someone has Parkinson’s or not, it can take time for the picture to become clearer. In some cases that means a change in the first diagnosis.

There are many management options to help with Parkinson’s. A range of different professionals can be involved. See the <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies/who-may-be-involved" class="internal-link">_Who May Be Involved_</a> page. Exercise has been shown to improve mobility and quality of life. There isn’t one exercise program that has been shown to be the best. Finding something you enjoy and doing it regularly is most important. Examples include an exercise class for people with Parkinson’s, dancing, boxing, riding a stationary bicycle at home, etc.

There are medications available for many Parkinson’s symptoms. See <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies/who-may-be-involved" class="internal-link">_Medications_</a> page. Surgical options may be considered in select cases. See <a href="/learn/treatments-and-therapies/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">_Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments_</a> page. There are also other strategies to reduce the impact of symptoms on daily life. See <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/managing-symptoms" class="internal-link">_Managing Symtoms_</a> pages. A diagnosis of Parkinson’s is a lot to deal with. Talking to others can help. This website aims to support you to live well with Parkinson’s. It includes a range of tools as well as information resources to help you. If you have been recently diagnosed, the volume of information can be overwhelming. Starting with the <a href="/learn/newly-diagnosed" class="internal-link">_Newly Diagnosed_</a> page may be most helpful. On this page, other people with Parkinson’s wrote key information they would focus on at the start.

Lots is known about Parkinson’s. But there is even more to be discovered! See the <a href="/learn/research" class="internal-link">_Research_</a> page to know more.

## Other Types of Parkinsonism

Parkinsonism is a term used to describe a group of symptoms namely: bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity. Parkinson’s disease is a type of Parkinsonism but there are others. There are a range of other diagnoses each of which have features of Parkinsonism but with additional symptoms. Please see links below for further details. Other Parkinsonian conditions can be very difficult to diagnose, as symptoms can look similar to PD and only reveal themselves/change with time. Your specialist will look out for these.
