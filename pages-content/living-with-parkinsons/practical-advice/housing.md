# Housing

Some people can have difficulties with living well within their home. For example, difficulties with climbing stairs, or their bathroom. This section covers home adaptations that can help support you to live independently within your own home. It also covers your options if your home is no longer suitable for you.

## Staying in your Own Home

For many people, the preference is to stay at home which can be helped by making small changes. Equipment and adaptations to your home, can help you stay independent at home for longer. Equipment is discussed on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page, and below we cover possible home adaptations.

In some cases, Home Support or Home Care Workers may also help. ‘Home Help’ refers to support for domestic tasks such as laundry, washing up and cleaning. ‘Home Care’ refers to support for personal tasks such as showering, dressing and preparing meals. See the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page for more information.

## Home adaptations

Before making major changes or buying equipment, seek advice from a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. Occupational therapists work with you to help maintain your health and independence. They may show you different ways to make certain tasks easier or suggest other practical changes. If appropriate, they can carry out an assessment and recommend what options are most suitable for you. Contact your GP, Parkinson’s nurse, Parkinson’s specialist, local social services, or social work department to arrange a home visit from an occupational therapist.

Your GP may also be able to refer you to rehabilitation and reablement services in the community, if available.

There are many options for equipment and aids to support you in tasks for day-to-day living. These are covered on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page. Options for more significant changes to your home are discussed here:

### General Adaptations

- Minor adaptations include installing grab rails, e.g. in hallways or stairways. These give a steady item to hold on to when moving around the home.
- Major adaptations to reduce the risks or difficulties associated with stairs:
  - Installing a **Stair Lift**.
  - Installing a **Through-Floor Lift**.
  - **Relocating rooms:** Moving to single-level living by rearranging or modifying to have everything on one floor. For example, moving the bedroom and bathroom downstairs. This may involve converting a dining room or living room. It can be helpful to remove items not frequently used to another area in the house to make space.
- **‘Telecare’:** Installation of technology, such as alarm systems or sensors can increase safety and security. For example, sensors on doors to indicate someone has gone through, or sensors on the floor to detect if someone falls. Different devices are discussed on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page; please also see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/balance-and-falls" class="internal-link">_Balance & Falls_</a> page if relevant.

### Bedroom Adaptations

Much can be improved with equipment rather than needing adaptations, see the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page for details. More significant modifications could include:

- **Over-bed trapezes & rope ladders** – designed to allow a person to pull themselves up from a lying to sitting position. They require a lot of upper body strength, and don’t tend to suit people with Parkinson’s. If you did want to pursue this, we recommend speaking to a professional first.
- **Built in hoists** – Hoists are equipment that lift a person between a bed and a (wheel) chair, or a bed and a commode, and back. They are discussed in more detail on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page. There are types that are built-in, called **Gantry hoists**. These are attached to the floor in a frame.  
  Through floor or ceiling track hoists can be built into the ceiling.

### Bathroom Adaptations

Instead of, or as well as bathroom equipment, adaptations include:

- Minor adaptation would be to install **built-in grab rails**. These can give stability and confidence near the shower, bath, or toilet. They can be free-standing rails or hinged drop-down rails that fix to the wall behind the toilet. The best rail for you will depend on:
  - Whether a fixed rail will fit the area around your toilet.
  - Whether it will be at the right height.
  - Whether you will need to adjust the rail.
- **Shower seats**, discussed on the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/daily-living" class="internal-link">_Daily Living_</a> page, can be fixed to a wall by the shower.
- **Adding a bathroom to the ground floor**. If getting up the stairs is difficult, an option could be to install a bathroom downstairs. This may mean converting a storage space or bedroom.
- **Installing wash dry toilets** can help with cleaning difficulties.
- **Anti-slip tiles or adding adhesive anti-slip material** to the bottom and edges of the bath or shower and railings can prevent slipping when the floor gets wet during your shower.
- **Converting the bathroom to a wet room**. If climbing into a bath is difficult or the shower cubicle is too small, then some people turn the bathroom into a wet room. The wet room will be on one level with non-slip tiles. As there is no need to step in or out of the shower/bath, it reduces the risk of slips and falls.

### Kitchen Adaptations

As well as the equipment and aid options, some people find these changes helpful:

- Arrangement of kitchen appliances: such that they are easier for you to reach.
  - Consider the height of appliances such as the microwave, kettle, sink, and hob.
  - Lowering or raising the height may make it easier for you to use them.
  - For example, lowering the countertop can make it easier for someone to use the kitchen while in a wheelchair if mobility is difficult.
- **Built-in hot water taps** can be installed and connected to a water supply for larger amounts of boiling water. You would not need to refill this like with a dispenser.

### Adaptations to Home Access

- Getting into your home may be trickier, particularly if there is a step.
  - Installing a rail by the front doorstep may help by giving you something to hold on to.
- Doors that use a key and lock can be challenging due to Parkinson’s. Tremor or difficulty gripping can make it hard to open locks with keys.
  - If equipment and aids are not sufficient, alternative options include smart locks/digital code lock. These are front door locks that doesn’t need a key. Instead, they use a key code, fob key, or even your mobile phone. For some people, this is easier than trying to handle smaller objects in their grip, such as keys.
- Some people find the difficulty getting is getting to the front door to let someone in. Adaptations to consider in this case are:
  - An **intercom** system, which would mean you didn’t have to go to the door.
  - **Key safe:** This is a small secure box, fitted to a wall outside the front door to hold the keys to your home. It requires a code to access: you choose who to give the code to. This can be very useful as multiple sets of keys do not need to be provided to family members or healthcare professionals. It will also allow people to access the house in case of an emergency.

As discussed, it is advised you seek professional advice before undertaking home adaptations. If however, you do plan to go ahead yourself, a few tips:

1. Be informed: The Disabled Living Foundation has more information.
2. Consider _how_ the adaptations will be used and the impact on others who use the space.
3. Try equipment before you buy it.
   - To find your nearest equipment demonstration centre, check the <a href="http://www.livingmadeeasy.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disabled Living Foundation's</a> website. You can search “equipment centre” for a list of equipment centres.
   - If possible, try out the different types to see which kind you find helpful.
   - The same website offers guidance on suppliers and allows you to compare products. You can search “askSARA” on their website for more information.
4. Make sure the _fit_ is correct.

### Funding Equipment or Adaptations

Standard equipment and smaller adaptations (for example, an additional stair rail or raised toilet seat) recommended by an occupational therapist are often provided free of charge. Some basic alarm systems may be available through Adult Social Care services, or you can buy them yourself either online or from high street shops.

You can apply to your local council for equipment or potential funding for adaptations if you need it because of your disability or age. Search for “home equipment” at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK website</a> for more information. Or an occupational therapist will be able to contact the relevant services or council departments after a home visit.

If you need major changes to your home, you might be able eligible for a disabled facilities grant. Funding for major home adaptations is often means-tested. This means the amount of funding you receive depends on how much money you have, including any savings.

If you have a disability or long-term health condition, you should not be charged VAT on products designed or adapted for your own personal or domestic use (including some home equipment). See our <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/practical-advice/appointments-and-hospital-stays" class="internal-link">_Finances_</a> page for more information on how to apply for VAT relief and other financial benefits.

_Tip: Contact your local fire service who will provide a ‘safe and well check.’ They are completely free, and you may be entitled to free smoke alarms. The purpose of these checks is to identify any fire risks and help reduce those risks._

It is important that you are happy, comfortable, and safe wherever you are living. Some people may want to move where they can receive support as it may be getting more challenging to manage at home. There are several options you can consider in terms of types of accommodation:

### Moving in with family

- Some people prefer to be closer to loved ones if they are struggling at home.
- Living with family can work very well but it is important to set out rules early to make sure everyone has the same expectations.
- For example, will you be paying towards rent, will the home need to be adapted, is there a plan in case the living situation no longer works?

### Sheltered accommodation

- Sheltered housing is suitable for people who would like the added security of having a bit more support but still want to live independently.
- It typically has wardens or staff you can call on for any issues.
- There will be emergency cords and personal alarms that people within the building can respond to.
- There may be more social activities and opportunities to join in with.
- Sheltered accommodation can either be rented or bought. The cost will vary across different housing schemes.

### Assisted living

- Assisted living (also known as extra-care housing) is similar to sheltered accommodation but provides even more support to its residents.
- This means you can still live independently within your own flat, but the level of staffing is increased to 24 hours a day.
- Staff can provide support with personal care and domestic tasks.
- On average, assisted living is more expensive than sheltered accommodation.

### Residential care

- There are different types of residential care homes, some of which share similar aspects to assisted living.
- Residential care may be more appropriate than assisted living for people who require more support day-to-day.
- There are nursing residential care homes for people that may need support from qualified nurses as well as personal care.

For more information on the different types of accommodation, visit the housing options page on the <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/information-advice/care/housing-options/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age UK</a> website.

## What can I do myself?

If you want to find what types of accommodation are near you, contact your local council. They can provide you with a list of sheltered accommodation, assisted living, and residential care options. If you are not sure which is most suitable, adult social care services can do an assessment and help. Your local council can also explain who gets priority for local authority or housing association rented accommodation, and how long you might have to wait for a place. <a href="https://www.ageuk.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Age UK</a> or <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Parkinson's UK</a> may be able to give free advice about housing benefits and what to look for in a care home.

Key steps in finding the right accommodation:

1. Get a list of available places in your local area.
2. Make sure it provides the **right level of support** for you. Bear in mind what you may need in the future.
3. Ring the accommodation to **find out costs and vacancies**. If there are no vacancies at that time, it may be helpful to find out the length of their waiting list and who would get priority.
4. **Speak to the warden or manager** to find out more information. You can visit the <a href="https://www.cqc.org.uk/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Care Quality Commission</a> website to see ratings of residential care and assisted living options (sheltered accommodation is not rated).
5. **Arrange a visit** in person before committing or agreeing to anything. This can help you get a sense of whether the location, facilities, staff or other residents fit in with your expectations.
