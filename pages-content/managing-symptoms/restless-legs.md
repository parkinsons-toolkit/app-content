# Restless Legs
Restless leg syndrome can feel like:
- An irresistible urge to move your legs  
- A pins and needles sensation in your legs  
- A burning sensation in your legs  

These sensations usually occur in the evening while you are relaxing. Moving your legs will likely make them immediately feel better, but the sensations will return once they are still again. Because these feelings tend to occur or get worse at night, they can disrupt people’s sleeping schedules.

## What Might Be Causing It?
- Restless leg syndrome can be due to Parkinson’s and the low level of dopamine in the brain.
- Non-Parkinson’s causes of restless leg include low iron, reduced kidney function, or pregnancy; but most cases of restless leg don’t have a clear cause. It can also run in families.
- Alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and some medications tend to make the symptoms of restless leg worse.

## What Should I Do About It?
If you have new symptoms of restless leg (as described above), or have never consulted a professional about it before, you should speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. 
 
Mild cases of restless leg may be treated with lifestyle changes, but more moderate or severe cases of restless leg may require medication. You should speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team if restless legs are interfering with your sleep. You should also speak to them if you are not able to manage it with lifestyle changes.

## Further Assessment
### Questions
Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**
- What the sensations in your legs feel like, when they occur, and what makes them feel better.

**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>**
- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- For restless leg symptoms you could record when you have the feelings in your legs, including how long it lasts, for example over the course of a week.

### Tests
Your GP may check your ferritin or iron levels. This is to see if a low iron level is contributing to your symptoms. Very occasionally, if another cause is suspected, they may run further tests. This can include other blood tests or tests of the electrical activity in the nerves.

- You may be asked to eat more iron-rich foods, examples include:
  - Shellfish, red meat, turkey, ham o Beans, iron-enriched breads and cereals

### Medication
- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- In moderate or severe cases of restless leg syndrome, treatment with medication may be necessary. 

**Medication that may be tried:**
- Parkinson’s medication: such as dopamine agonists or levodopa o Medication used for nerve pain, such as gabapentin or pregabalin (used cautiously).
