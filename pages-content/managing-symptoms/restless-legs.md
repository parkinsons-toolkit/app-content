# Restless Legs

## Introduction
Restless leg syndrome (RLS) can feel like:
- An irresistible urge to move your legs  
- A pins and needles sensation in your legs  
- A burning sensation in your legs  

These sensations usually occur in the evening while relaxing. Moving your legs provides temporary relief, but the sensations return once still. Because they often worsen at night, they may disrupt sleep.

---

## What Might Be Causing It?
- Parkinson’s and the low level of dopamine in the brain.  
- Non-Parkinson’s causes include low iron, reduced kidney function, or pregnancy.  
- Many cases have no clear cause, though it can run in families.  
- Alcohol, smoking, caffeine, and some medications can worsen symptoms.  

---

## What Should I Do About It?
- If new symptoms arise, or you’ve never discussed them before, speak to your **GP or Parkinson’s specialist team**.  
- Mild cases may improve with lifestyle changes.  
- Moderate or severe cases may require medication, especially if sleep is affected.  

---

## What Can I Try for Myself?
- Leg massage, walking, and stretching (see *Keeping Active* page).  
- Warm or cool compresses on the legs.  
- Warm bath in the evening (make sure you are well hydrated first).  
- Avoid alcohol, caffeine, and smoking, especially in the evening.  
- Establish regular sleeping habits.  
- Maintain a cool sleeping environment.

## Further Assessment
Healthcare professionals may ask:
- What sensations do you feel in your legs?  
- When do they occur?  
- What makes them better?  

### Track Your Symptoms
Use the **Symptom and Activity Tracker**:
- Record when symptoms occur and how long they last.  
- Tracking over a week may help identify patterns.  

---

## Tests
- **Ferritin/iron level check** → low iron can contribute.  
- Rarely, further blood tests or nerve electrical activity tests.  

---

## Further Treatments

### Treating the Cause
If iron levels are low:
- Eat more iron-rich foods:  
  - Shellfish, red meat, turkey, ham  
  - Beans, iron-enriched breads/cereals  
  - Dark green vegetables, raisins, prunes, apricots  
- Iron tablets may be prescribed.  
⚠️ Iron tablets can cause constipation (see *Bowel Symptoms* page).  

### Medication
Only to be adjusted by doctors (GP, neurologist) or Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses:  
- **Parkinson’s medication** → dopamine agonists or levodopa  
- **Nerve pain medication** → gabapentin or pregabalin (used cautiously)  
- **Painkillers** → codeine, tramadol  
  - Must be monitored due to constipation and side effects

## Key Messages
- RLS feels like burning, pins and needles, or an urge to move the legs.  
- Symptoms typically occur at night or when relaxing, often disturbing sleep.  
- Always check ferritin levels to rule out low iron.  
- Lifestyle changes and medication can both help.
