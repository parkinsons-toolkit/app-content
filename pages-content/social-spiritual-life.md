# Social & Spiritual Life

‘group chat’ for family or friends using a messaging App (e.g.
WhatsApp). You could also use online forums to find people with similar interests. If you would
like to learn how to use a computer, contact your local library or council. Or contact Age UK,
who offer local training sessions.

- If you are feeling very lonely, there are services that can help. Most GP practices now have
  access to a link worker. This person can help you to find something that suits you to help with
  feeling lonely. You can ask your GP practice reception about
  this. Some areas have services to connect you to volunteers
  who can help too. You can also call The Silver Line on 0800 4
  70 80 90, which is a confidential service open 24 hours a day,
  7 days a week. It is designed to offer conversation,
  friendship, provide advice and link callers to local groups or
  services.
  Practical ti ps
  If mobility difficulties mean that you’re more reliant on the phone to keep in touch, it might be
  worth reviewing your phone package to make sure you’re on the best tariff for voice calls. One
  way you can do this is by getting in touch with your network provider to make sure you’re on
  the best tariff or call package.
  Video calls can also be a great way of keeping in touch with friends and family as well as accessing,
  for example, exercise classes or religious services. If you’re not yet confident with this technology,
  there are guides on the Age UK site and on the BBC site.
  If reduced mobility is making access to shops and to social gatherings more difficult, then you
  could be eligible for a Blue Badge which will entitle you to priority parking. See our Travel page
  for more information on the Blue Badge Scheme. You can also visit your council website and
  Parkinson’s UK website for more information and guidance.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“It’s so nice to go out to a shop… because that brings you back into the community which
is very important I think. One of the things you shouldn’t do is to lose touch with your
community or communities”
“My grandma lives in America so we don’t get to see her much. My aunt showed her how
to use Snapchat on her phone - she doesn’t really use computers. She said it was easy to
use once she was shown how. She sends me pictures of her garden and I send her funny
photos of me or my sister every week. She says she really likes this as she lives on her own
and cant go out now”
Relationships
As your Parkinson's progresses, you may notice a change in your relationships. This might be with
your partner, family, friends, colleagues, and so on. These changes may be positive or negative.
For example, you may become more distant to some friends but build deeper connections with
others.
Family and friends
When you feel ready, you may wish to have an honest conversation with your friends about your
condition. It might be helpful to try to maintain closest connections with people who are
supportive and willing to learn more about Parkinson’s.
It may be tempting to withdraw from friendships. However, it’s important to stay connected with
those around you as they can be a great source of happiness and support.
Romantic relationships
If you have Parkinson’s, or are caring for someone who does, you may find it affects your
relationships. But there are things you can do which may help you either improve or adjust to
these changes.
First reactions
The way you and your partner react to a Parkinson’s diagnosis can have an impact on how you
feel. People can experience a range of emotions, including anger, frustration, denial and even
relief. It is likely you will cycle through a number of different emotional stages after a diagnosis.
You can expect to experience a period of adjustment for both you and your partner.
Parkinson’s UK run a ‘First Steps’ course for people who are newly diagnosed and a partner/friend.
These are hosted by people who have Parkinson’s and can be a helpful way of coming to terms
with the diagnosis and developing positive expectations. See the Parkinson’s UK website for more
information on the course and how to join.
Expectations
You and your partner may have different expectations
of Parkinson’s. For example, one of you may be more
optimistic about the future or have different views on
how best to manage your condition. Try discussing
your opinions with each other without judgement.
This can help you both understand each other’s views
and reduce any conflict. Make sure you have accurate
information about Parkinson’s as this will help to
make sure both of your expectations are realistic.
Emotional changes
After a diagnosis of Parkinson’s, some couples can feel a sense of grieving for the
life they used to have. This can be due to the possible changes in lifestyle, personal identity, and
working life. Also, symptoms such as involuntary movements (dyskinesia) and trouble controlling
saliva can make some people feel self-conscious. They may then become withdrawn which can
change the dynamics in a relationship.
The emotional impact of having relationship difficulties can make other situations more difficult
to manage. Try not to deal with these emotions on your own. Talk with your partner about the
relationship as this can bring you closer together. It may help you both feel more positive about
the situation.
Changing roles
When someone has Parkinson’s, it is common for relationship roles to change. For example, you
and your partner may take the roles of carer and cared-for. This can be difficult to adjust to,
particularly if your relationship was very different before. Some couples can find it hard to see
each other as equal partners in these new roles.
Tips:

- Maintain a sense of independence. Give yourselves time to do activities separately as well as
  together
- Take chances to reverse the caring role. For example, the person with Parkinson’s providing
  their partner with emotional or intellectual support
- Find activities that remind you that you are both equals, for example watching a film or

socialising with friends

- Keep communicating with each other. Parkinson’s can affect communication in different ways,
  whether it’s verbal, written, or facial expressions. But it’s important to try to keep these
  channels open as much as possible
- Ask for help if you’re finding it hard to manage problems. Professionals such as Parkinson’s
  specialist nurses, counsellors, and psychologists can offer support and guidance.
  Intimate relationships
  If you are in a relationship, sexual problems can affect both the person with Parkinson’s and their
  partner. Finding out one of you has a long-term condition can change your physical relationship.
  The need for intimacy may become more or less important. It can also impact your sexual self-
  esteem; the person with Parkinson’s may feel less desirable while their partner might worry about
  being too demanding by wanting sex.
  Changes in sexual relationships can happen to any couple at any time, regardless of whether
  someone has a long-term condition. These challenges may resolve themselves. But, if this is not
  the case, a couple may wish to try:
- Making adjustments which take into account changing physical abilities
- Redefining expectations to fit with the circumstances at hand
  If you both feel comfortable, it can help to have open, but sensitive, discussions about your desires
  and limitations when it comes to sex. This may make it easier to face the challenges and find
  solutions that work for you both.
  For more information on Parkinson’s and sexual function, see our Sexual Function page.
  Where can I go for information and support?
- Relationship counselling – counsellors can work with couples and individuals (meaning you
  can go alone if you’re single or your partner does not wish to take part)
- Ask your GP for services available in your area o Contact your local ‘Relate’ centre - visit
  their website to find your nearest Relate and give them a call. You can find the link in
  our More Information section.
- Counselling and psychotherapy for sexual problems o Counselling or psychotherapy provides
  a safe space to talk openly about any sexual problems you’re experiencing. It can help you to
  find ways of making changes
- Ask your GP for services available in your local area.
- Psychosexual therapy o A psychosexual therapist is trained in all aspects of sex. They can help
  you to understand the effects of things like medication and illness on sex
- You can see a psychosexual therapist on your own or as a couple
- Ask your GP for services available in your area.
  Spirituality and religion
  Spirituality and religion varies from person to person. It can provide someone with a sense of
  comfort and support. Your faith leader and community can be a great source of practical and
  emotional support.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I’m a Christian and I’m quite
involved with our church and I spend a lot of time

with people. And because I am sitting a lot of the
time, people actually confide in me and like
coming here, you know, and spending time in my

home. I wouldn’t be able to do that if I was
working. So these are the things that I have got
to think positively about.” (Person with
Parkinson’s)
If you have Parkinson’s, or care for someone that does, it can be difficult to attend religious
meetings, due to practical and emotional challenges. There are many benefits of staying
connected with your religious group/meetings so explore ways to overcome barriers to attending
these (e.g. ask a friend to support you attending). If you need to arrange transport to attend
religious gatherings, see our Travel page for advice. In response to the Coronavirus pandemic,
many places of worship have offered online services, which are a great help to those with mobility
difficulties.
Fasting
A religious practice that has particular challenges for people with Parkinson’s is fasting, for
example for Ramadan. Fasting is thought to be safe for healthy individuals to practise. But, if you
are older or have a chronic condition (such as Parkinson’s) you are advised to avoid fasting.
Religious texts generally allow you to break fasting for these reasons due to the negative impact
it can have on health. Fasting may cause someone with Parkinson's to have dehydration, weight
loss, and metabolic changes. If medicines are not taken due to the fast, this can worsen symptoms
and may cause withdrawal effects.
You should speak with your specialist if you are planning on fasting. They may be able to suggest
adjustments to your treatment, including:

- Extended-release dopamine agonists o Due to the slow release of the drug, you only need to
  take it once a day (e.g. at dawn before the start of the fasting period)
- Transdermal patch o This delivers the medication through the skin directly into the
  bloodstream. As the drug is delivered without entering the gastrointestinal tract, the patch
  can be used without breaking the fast
  These adjustments will not be suitable for everyone. Options will vary depending on the severity
  of the condition and current medications. Your specialist can assess this and discuss what
  adjustments will be suitable for you.
  You should have a consultation one month after the end of a period of fasting like Ramadan. The
  specialist can then make sure control of the condition has been regained. They can also make any
  further adjustments to treatment if needed.

Dealing with Stress and Challenges
Stress can often make symptoms such as tremor worse. Learning how to cope with stressful life
events can help you to manage symptoms and maintain a good quality of life.
Even when emotionally and mentally healthy, you may still experience negative emotions, these
are part of normal life. Having good emotional health means developing the ability to bounce
back from difficult situations.
