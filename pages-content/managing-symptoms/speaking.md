Speech difficulties are common in Parkinson’s. They include a range of symptoms. But not everyone with Parkinson’s will have the issues discussed in this section. Problems with speech include quiet, slurred, hoarse-sounding voice; monotone; and difficulty with tongue and lip movements. It may feel like you are wearing a mask.

## What might be causing it?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/speech-therapy.jpg" alt="speech" class="speaking__speech-therapy">

Parkinson’s causes changes in the brain. This leads to movements becoming smaller and less forceful. This can impact your voice. The condition can affect how the brain thinks. It affects your thought processes, which may slow down. Or you may find it hard to find the right word to say. Many people with Parkinson’s don’t know they are speaking quietly.

There are reasons other than Parkinson’s that cause changes in speech. It could be something within the mouth, throat, or jaw (e.g. poorly fitting dentures or a throat infection). Other medical conditions affecting the brain can also cause speech problems (for example, a stroke which has caused weakness on one side of the face or affected the brain pathways for finding words). Speech changes in Parkinson’s tends to occur gradually. Sudden problems are less likely to be related to Parkinson’s.

## What should I do about it?

There are things you can do yourself to improve your speech. If symptoms are progressing and affecting your life, or you are worried about related symptoms, see your GP. You should discuss your concerns with your Parkinson’s specialist team at your next appointment.

If you have a new hoarse voice that has lasted more than three weeks you should see your GP.

<ins>Very sudden</ins> changes in speech, usually with weakness of one side of the face, could be a stroke. In this case, call for an ambulance using 999. Very sudden means occurring like a ‘snap of the fingers’.

## What can I try for myself?

### Speech Techniques

- Try to relax by making sure you’re sitting or standing comfortably before speaking, with a posture that helps you take in a good breath.
- Every time you speak, imagine you’re speaking to the people at the back of a big room. This will help you speak clearly and at the right volume.
- Try to make each word as clear as possible and speak slowly.
- You may find it useful to practise saying things in a simpler way. You can keep sentences short and stress key words.

### Getting speech exercises into everyday life

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/singing.jpg" alt="singing" class="speaking__speech-therapy">


It is important you practise the following with a clear voice, as rehearsing with a hoarse voice will cause more problems. A hoarse voice should clear if you talk louder.

- **Singing:** A hobby that may be a social and fun way to increase your confidence in your voice.
  - Singing exercises for your voice and breathing muscles may help your speaking voice.
  - There are singing classes all over the UK for people with Parkinson’s - some are run by Parkinson’s UK local groups. Or perhaps just singing in the shower.
- **Socialising:** This gives you opportunities to practise your speech and improve confidence. See our <a href="/information/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/social-and-spiritual-life" class="internal-link">Social & Spiritual Life</a> page for more tips.
- **Reading aloud:** Whether it is stories, poetry or the news, try reading it out loud rather than in your head to exercise your speech.
- **Apps:** Some people use an app on their phone or computer to show how many decibels they use when speaking. This can help you realise how quiet or loud you are talking. Normal conversation is around 60 – 70 decibels. If you are interested in this, ask your therapist, who may be able to advise you further.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “I had one gentleman who loved telling stories to his grandchildren. So I said, Well why don’t you record them and, if you record it loud enough, then that’s your exercise.”
> (Speech & Language Therapist)

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/information/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">My Reminders and Notes</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They might ask about**

- Do you have problems swallowing food, drink or medicines?
- Do you have new weakness in your arms or legs?
- Have you had any unintentional weight loss?
- Do you have any concerns about your memory?
- Do you have a sore throat?
- Can you hear as well as you used to?
- Lifestyle: smoking and alcohol

**Track your symptoms in the** <a href="/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns.
- For speech problems you could record:
  - When it is most problematic, and when it is at its best.
  - What you are doing at the time.
  - When you have taken your medication, to see if there is a relationship.
- You do not need to endlessly track your symptoms: 3-5 days should be plenty to look for a pattern.

### Tests

Most cases do not need further tests. Depending on the healthcare professional’s assessment, they may carry out blood tests, a scan of your head or neck, or a camera test to look at your throat and vocal cords.

## Further Treatments

### Referral

- You may be referred on to another service.
- Referral might be to:
  - Speech and language therapists. They assess and advise on speech. In particular, they can help with voice, speech clarity, and volume. See them early if your Parkinson’s causes any changes in your speech.
  - Physiotherapists. They may help with stiffness and strength. They can help you to control body language. This is a key component of communication.
  - You may be referred to other hospital specialities (e.g. Ear Nose and Throat specialists) if a non-Parkinson’s cause is suspected.

### Medication

- Doctors and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your drugs.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- Parkinson’s drugs (e.g. levodopa) may help your speech.
- Response to Parkinson's drugs changes over time. For example, your voice may be stronger when the drugs are working well and softer or weaker when your drugs are not working well.
- Changes to your Parkinson’s drugs may give you better control over speech problems.
- See <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/variability-of-symptoms" class="internal-link">Variability of Symptoms</a> for more information about these changes in your speech and other symptoms.

## Key Messages

- Parkinson's can cause speech problems but is not the only cause. Discuss with your GP if you are unsure what is causing changes in your speech.
- See a Speech and language therapist as early as possible. They can provide techniques and exercises to help improve your speech.
