# Legal Matters

may be a time where you lose the ability to make decisions for yourself, which we
refer to as decision making capacity.
This may be because you:

- can’t understand what is being asked,
- weigh up benefits or risks,
- retain information given to you,
- communicate your decision to others.

Power of attorney provides someone that you trust with the legal power to make decisions in your

best interests. However, a power of attorney can only be arranged when you have the ability and
understanding to do so, that is you are assessed as having mental capacity. Therefore, it is
important to decide as early as possible whether you want to have someone acting on your behalf,

in your best interests in the future and if so, who that person or people would be.
This section will outline the different types of power of attorney and other common questions
surrounding powers of attorney. The information relates to England and Wales (Mental Capacity

Act 2005).
Types of Power of Attorney

- Ordinary power of Attorney is for financial decisions only and is only valid if this is drawn up while
  you still have ability to make decisions. For example: Someone may still be able to manage their
  money. However, they would prefer a trusted person to make a decision if they were planning to
  be out of the country for some time – for example. Jane, for instance, is going back to Jamaica for
  a long holiday, she appoints her niece Donna to deal with a specific matter concerning her house
  sale while she is away. A solicitor will help with drawing up such a document giving Donna the
  power to sign relevant legal papers while her aunt is away.
- Lasting power of Attorney (LPA). There are two separate types of lasting power of attorney
  (health and welfare AND property and affairs). You can choose to apply for just one or both. o
  Health and welfare: Once registered, the health and welfare LPA can be used by the person or
  people you have chosen if you can no longer make decisions for yourself. This is known as losing
  mental capacity. Health and welfare decisions could include deciding where you should live,
  medical treatment, and your day to day care.
- Finance and affairs: Once registered, the finance LPA will automatically be valid. Therefore,
  the person you trust can make financial decisions both now and in the future. This can be
  at a time when you may or may not be able to make decisions yourself. Financial decisions
  could include paying bills, paying the mortgage, buying and selling property.
- Enduring power of Attorney (EPA) o Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA) was used before lasting
  power of attorney replaced it in October 2007. EPA cover finances. If you signed an EPA before
  1st October 2007 then it should still be valid, but you may want to make a LPA to reflect other
  decisions.
  When should I consider this?
  Lasting power of attorney is a decision that everyone should consider as they get older as soon as
  possible. You may decide that you do not want a power of attorney. You will need to choose a
  specific person or people whom you trust to be your power of attorney (e.g. partner, child, friend).
  Either way it is important to put your wishes in place as soon as possible.
  Over time, your preferences may change or the person you choose may not be available and so
  you might want to make a new document. For example, you may change your mind as to whom
  you want registered as having power of attorney or you may have chosen one type of LPA and
  want to extend it.
  What should I do?
  If you decide you would like to appoint someone to have lasting power of attorney for you, there
  are a number of steps to take:

1. You should make sure the person/people you would like to appoint is/are happy to take on
   the responsibility. It is also important to clearly outline your expectations with that person or
   people.
2. You can contact the Office of the Public Guardian
   (0300 456 0300) for Lasting Power of Attorney
   forms and information pack. The forms can also be
   printed or completed online. Go to the GOV.UK
   website and type “lasting power of attorney” in the
   search bar.
3. The ‘health and welfare’ and ‘finance and affairs’
   powers of attorney are two separate documents.
   Therefore, they require two separate applications
   should you want both.
4. You can complete these forms without a lawyer. However, getting professional help may
   reduce potential mistakes and prevent problems later. You can seek information from the
   Citizens Advice or Office of the Public Guardian directly.
5. An impartial professional (for example, a doctor, solicitor or social worker) must sign the
   document. This is to confirm that you have not been forced into signing the power of attorney
   under pressure. This person is known as a “certificate provider”.
6. The completed document must be sent to the Office of the Public Guardian to be registered.
   There is a registration fee. However, this can be reduced depending on your income.
7. The registration and decision process can take 8-9 weeks. During this time the power of
   attorney cannot be used.
8. You may be unsure if your power of attorney is registered. If so, you can contact the Office of
   the Public Guardian to ask (0300 456 0300).
   You will be assessed to see if you have capacity to make this decision. This assessment will be by
   an impartial professional and the Office of the Public Guardian. If they believe you do not have
   capacity, then you have a couple of options. 1) Reapply at another time when you may be
   deemed to have capacity; 2) Someone can apply for something called deputyship from the Court
   of Protection.
   Deputyship is a similar role to someone who is an attorney. Similar to lasting power of attorney
   there are two types, property and affairs, and personal welfare. Deputyship can be applied when
   someone lacks the ability to make their own decisions. However, there are far more processes to
   applying for deputyship than arranging a lasting power of attorney. 1) Becoming a deputy costs
   more money. 2) Deputyship requires an annual deputyship report to be sent to the Court of
   Protection. This is to make sure the person acting as deputy is acting in your best interests. This
   may offer a sense of protection for some.
   What if I do not want to make a lasting power of attorney?
   It is important to understand that it is your decision. You should not feel pressured by anyone into
   something you do not feel comfortable with. You may decide you do not want to appoint someone
   to have power of attorney. However, it is worth understanding some of the reasons why it might
   be useful:

- Being married or in a civil partnership does not mean your partner can make financial or health
  decisions on your behalf.
- If you lose ability to make decisions without an LPA in place, then the Court of Protection may
  get involved (if you have not much money then you may have an appointeeship made to manage
  benefits and savings).
- The Court of Protection can make health and financial decisions on behalf or someone who does
  not have capacity to do so. They can also appoint someone to make decisions on your behalf.
  This may be a health professional or someone you trust.
- Having a deputy instead of having a person with LPA is more costly but there will be more
  supervision of a deputy in comparison to someone who has power of attorney.
  What should I do if I am having problems with the person given power of attorney
  that I selected?
- You can make a complaint if you are having problems with your attorney:
- Contact the Office of the Public Guardian to raise your concerns. You can also contact your
  local authority social services. An investigation will then take place to assess these
  concerns
  (i.e. financial abuse) o Contact the charity Hourglass
  ([https://wearehourgla](https://wearehourgla)ss.org/helpline). It provides confidential advice to older people who
  may be experiencing harm or abuse o If you are in immediate danger, call 999.

  Formally Recording Future Wishes
  You can make a record of your wishes for how you
  would like to be treated in the future – for example if
  you can no longer tell anyone. This can be used in a
  situation in the future where you may not be able to
  decide for yourself. You can choose whether you
  would prefer a formal document that is signed and
  legally binding. Or, an informal non legal document
  that outlines your preferences. These future wishes
  might cover health and care.
  Types of documentation to record future wishes
  There are two main types of documentation to record future wishes. One is a statement of wishes
  and the other is an advance decision. These are two different documents.
  Statement of wishes
- A statement of wishes is a chance to share your preferences with professionals and your
  family and friends. This document might be referred to in the future if you can no longer make
  decisions for yourself or tell people what you want.
- This statement can include preferences about what you might like to eat, where you would
  like to be cared for, what you would like to do, and personal care routines. It is best to write
  this down and include the date and your signature; if you do not then people are not likely to
  know what you wanted.
- Your GP, solicitor or Citizens advice should be able to provide you with advice should you have
  questions around setting out your statement of wishes but they will remind you that no-one
  has to follow them and they may get lost or be unavailable.
- Important to Consider: statements of wishes are not legally binding. Whoever is making
  decisions should try to respect what you have said as best as possible. However, there may
  be times the decision will go against the statement. For example: you may have said you
  would like to stay at home, rather than go into a care home. However, it may become too
  difficult or unsafe for you to be cared for at home. Therefore, it may be in your best interests
  to move to a care home. You may say you would always prefer a bath rather than a
  shower. While that may not be possible always it might help someone thinking about what to
  ask a care worker to help you with.
  Advance decision
- An advance decision instructs health and care professionals and family to follow your wishes
  about refusing treatment. This can be helpful at a time when you may no longer be able to
  communicate or make the decision.
- Advance decision is also known as an advance decision to refuse treatment or a living will
- An advance decision is legally binding providing it is

1. in writing
2. signed by you when you had capacity
3. signed by a witness.

This witness does not have to be a health or legal professional. However, it is advisable that they
are. Your GP could discuss potential future treatment options with you. GPs can also make sure
that the document is valid and should be followed.

- Do not resuscitate (DNR) orders (also known as DNARs and DNACPRs) are specific types of
  advance decision. DNRs are a legal instruction to withhold any method of life support in respect

of the patient’s wishes. You must complete this with a doctor present. Doctors may complete one
too.
What if the attorney I appointed does not agree with my advance
decision?
If valid, your advance decision will overrule decisions made by your deputy or person given power
of attorney (so for example the person with lasting power of attorney may want you to have anti-
biotics (for example if you get an infection) but you may have said in your advance decision that
you do not want to take them.
When should I consider this?
Recording future wishes should be considered by us all as we get older. There are some
advantages in doing them early and reviewing them. You may decide that you do not have any
future care wishes. Or, you may have wishes about your care that you would like your family and
health professionals to respect. Either way it is important to have this talk early and put your
wishes in place. Over time, your wishes may change. If this does happen, you are allowed to make
changes to your statement of wishes or advance decision.
What should I do?
If you decide you would like to create a statement of wishes or advance decision, there are a
number of steps:

1. You can write down or verbally tell family members or health
   professionals (most likely GP) of your wishes. If you write your wishes down and sign the paper
   this will help. This is to reduce the chances of your wishes being misunderstood. NOTE: any
   advance decision with refusal of life- saving treatment must be in writing and signed by both
   yourself and a doctor.
2. There is no set way to complete an statement of wishes or advance decision but it is suggested
   that you include:

- statement of wishes o Full name, date of birth and home address o Statement
  outlining your capacity (ability to make decisions) o Any preferences relating to
  where you would like to be cared for, food and drink preferences, what you would
  like to do, your religious beliefs, what you would prefer about personal care and
  what you would like to happen if you become unwell. You can add or remove
  preferences that you feel are important to you.
- Advance decision o Full name, date of birth and home address o Name and address
  of GP o Statement outlining your capacity (ability to make decisions) o Clear
  statement of your refusal of specific treatment o What circumstances this statement
  will apply o Demonstrating understanding of what could happen if you refuse
  treatment
- Signature and date
- Signature from witness (doctor if it involves refusal of life-saving treatment)

3. It is important that you share your statement of wishes or advance decision with health and
   care professionals and family. Without telling health and care professionals or family, they will
   not have a record of your wishes or instructions. Therefore, you may want to provide your GP
   and family with a copy of your wishes or decisions. Some people carry a crisis card or health
   alert bracelet to say they have an advance decision.
4. It is important to tell your family / the people supporting you if you want to change your mind.
   Without telling anyone, they will follow your original decision. You can make changes at any
   time, providing that you are still able to make your own decisions.
   What further support is available?

- General Practitioner (GP). You can speak with your GP who will be able to provide advice on how
  best to write a clear statement of wishes or advance decision. The GP can also witness your advance
  decision document.
- Parkinson’s UK. Parkinson’s UK can provide general information around statements of wishes or
  advance decisions.
- Citizens Advice. Similar to Parkinson’s UK and Alzheimer’s Society, can provide support around
  the different types of ways to record formal wishes.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I have definitely got a ‘do not resuscitate’ notice on the back of my front door. I do not
want to be resuscitated. You know, I‘ve had a wonderful life, a long life. I initiated it. So
that’s firmly there. And I’ve written my own funeral service. It’ll be rather good. I’m
debating a rehearsal” (Person with Parkinson’s)
Wills
Taking the time to make a will can make sure your
property and money are given to the people you want
and divided in the ways you want. Without making a
will, the law will decide who gets what.
When should I consider this?
Similar to deciding on your lasting power of attorney and
future wishes, making your will should be considered by
everyone as they get older, as soon as possible. It is generally
recommended to write up and sign your will at the same time as arranging a power of attorney.
However, you may decide that you just want to write a will. Either way it is important to have
discussions early with the people affected. Over time, your wishes may change or the things you
talk about in your will have changed or no longer exist (e.g., you might have sold your car). If so,
it is worth having these discussions again to make any changes in your will. These changes can
only be made if you have the ability to understand the decision.
What should I do?
If you decide you would like to make your will, there are a number of steps:

1. Take time to decide on how you would like your assets to be divided.
2. You can write the will yourself, although it is recommended to use a solicitor. By using a
   solicitor it makes sure the document is legally valid and reduces any misinterpretation of your
   wishes. Some charities run free online will writing services and details of the national
   organisation coordinating this can be found below.

3. If you decide to instruct a solicitor, it is important before you start to get an outline of what
   they will charge and the level of detail in your will. Some solicitors provide a service for free
   but this may not be enough for your circumstances.
4. Sign the document in the presence of 2 witnesses and have the 2 witnesses sign, in your
   presence. It may be recommended that your doctor acts as a witness to confirm you have
   ability and capacity to make these decisions. It is important that you choose 2 witnesses who
   have not been left anything in your will.
5. Once signed and deemed valid, the wishes outlined in the will must be carried out.
6. If you would like to make changes, you will have to make an official
   alteration (known as a codicil). You must get the official alteration signed and witnessed in the
   same way as when you made the will. There are no limits to how many alterations you can
   make.

  Discrimination
  If you have a disability, such as Parkinson’s, you have rights that protect you from being wrongfully
  treated under the Equality Act 2010. This law helps to enforce and promote your rights to ensure
  you are not treated wrongfully based on your diagnosis of Parkinson’s.
  What should I do?
  If you feel that you have been wrongfully treated (e.g. by your employer, the police or any other
  organisation), you have a right to make a formal complaint:

1. Firstly, consider if the problem can be resolved informally by talking the people involved, a
   disability advisor and human resources
2. If the problem is still not resolved, then ask to make a formal complaint. Each organisation
   will have their own complaints procedure for you to follow. If there is no complaints
   procedure then make the complaint in writing anyway.
3. Contact Citizens Advice or the Equality Advisory and Support Service.
   [https://www.equalityhumanright](https://www.equalityhumanright)s.com/en/contact-us/equality-advisory-and-support-
   service . Both provide advice and information for the best approach on making formal
   complaints based on your personal situation.
4. If the problem is still occurring after the formal complaint then you may be able to contact an
   Ombudsman. An Ombudsman is someone who is independent, free and impartial who can be
   appointed to investigate complaints in certain areas. You can find your local Ombudsman
   through the Ombudsman Association, linked below.

  Mobility
  Introduction
  Mobility is quite a broad term and includes:

* Walking around
* Getting up or down stairs
* Getting in and out of bed
* Rolling over in bed: ‘bed mobility’
* Getting up from or sitting down into a chair.
  Reduced mobility may make everyday activities more challenging for you than they used to be.
  There are many things you can do for yourself. It is also advised that you see a physiotherapist or
  occupational therapist. They will work with you to help you continue doing the things you need
  and enjoy doing in your daily life.
  Symptoms of Parkinson’s and factors unrelated to Parkinson’s can all contribute to reduced
  mobility. These factors are discussed on the Balance & Falls page. Treatment of the symptoms
  causing problems is important for maintaining mobility. Please explore the Symptom
  Management pages for specific guidance.
  A common problem is that difficulties mobilising mean that you are less active. Being less active
  then leads to muscle weakness and stiffness. Muscle weakness and stiffness then leads to more
  difficulty in mobilising. Lack of confidence and fear of falling also feeds into this cycle. It is
  important to break this cycle.
  What should I do about it?
  If you have a sudden decline in your mobility, you should see your GP or contact your Parkinson’s
  team as soon as possible. There may be an illness, injury or medication that is contributing to it.
  Please see the Balance & Falls information page if these are concerns.
  If you have difficulties moving, you should be referred to a physiotherapist. In the NHS, you usually
  have to be referred by your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. You may also benefit from
  Occupational Therapist or Adult Social Care services.
  Appointments with these specialists may be in a hospital, community service, or at home. In some
  areas there are specialist Parkinson’s teams or rehab services. Your Parkinson’s specialist team or
  GP should be able to advise. See the Who May be Involved page for more information about the
  different services.
  What can I try for myself?
