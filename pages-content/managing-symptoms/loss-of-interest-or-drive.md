## Loss of Interest or Drive

Loss of interest or drive is sometimes called **apathy**.  
It is not the same as feeling low or depressed, although it can also be part of depression.

- To outsiders, apathy can be mistaken for laziness, but it can be a **symptom of Parkinson’s**.
- For some, it affects engagement with hobbies or pastimes.
- For others, it impacts routine daily activities such as self-care.

### Apathy vs Avoidance
- **Avoidance**: Not doing something because it is too difficult.
- **Apathy**: The person *can* do it (especially with encouragement) but has no desire or ability to start without prompting.
- Someone with apathy is **not avoiding** — they simply have no wish to do it or cannot get started.

If you feel like you have **lost your spark** or **can’t be bothered to do anything**, that might be apathy.

## What Might Be Causing It?

Apathy is a symptom of Parkinson’s as well as other neurological conditions.  
There is evidence that it is linked to the levels of dopamine in the brain.  
This link is different from how dopamine affects movement.

- Apathy in Parkinson’s can be present by itself.
- It can also be linked to low mood, memory, and thinking problems.

## What Should I Do About It?

The feeling of apathy can be hard to change. There is no quick fix, but:

- Routinely talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
- They can assess for a cause and potentially treat related symptoms.

Even if your interest and drive are low, it is important to remain active.  
Managing apathy benefits mental and physical health and helps those you live with.

## What Can I Try for Myself?

There are three main ways to tackle apathy:

1. **Establish a routine** so the activity becomes a habit.
2. **Build a menu** of activities to choose from.
3. **Agree with others** that they can prompt or remind you.

---

### Establishing a Routine

- Apathy tends to affect less frequent, optional activities.
- Regular habits are less affected.
- A daily or weekly routine can help tackle apathy and improve mood.
- Best routines include variety, with activities from different categories:

#### Chores
- Household or garden tasks you may have stopped doing.
- Could include taking over tasks from family members.
- May not be fun but are useful and often physically active.

#### Hobbies and Pastimes
- Often affected early in apathy.
- Find activities you can still do and include 1–2 in your routine.  
  *See Hobbies & Pets page for more advice.*

#### Physical Activity
- Apathy can cause physical inactivity.
- Include chores, hobbies, and exercise to stay active.
- Even small amounts of exercise are valuable.  
  *See Keeping Active page for more advice.*

#### Social Activity
- Plan chances to be around others (family, friends, groups).
- Schedule 2–3 activities each week (calls, visits, groups).
- Combine with hobbies, pastimes, or exercise.  
  *See Social & Spiritual Life page for more advice.*

### Make a ‘Menu’

- Helps for times when you feel like you have nothing to do.
- Easier to choose from a list than think from scratch.
- Keep it small, varied, and avoid activities that are too long or complex.
- Include options from chores, hobbies, physical, and social activities.

---

### The Importance of Prompts and Reminders

- People with apathy often don’t act without prompting.
- Family should feel encouraged to give reminders (not “nagging”).
- Prompts can include:
  - Talking through the daily routine.
  - Encouraging use of the activity menu.

## My Experience

> “I watch TV to distract. I lie down to distract. I get up and go for a walk around the house. Sometimes go out the front door, have a walk around the block.”

## Further Assessment

### Questions Professionals Might Ask
- How is your mood?
- Have you noticed any changes in your memory or thinking?
- Are there times when you feel engaged vs disinterested, or is it continuous?
- Any relationship with your medication?

---

## Tracking Symptoms

- Helps recall details and identify patterns.
- If remembering is difficult, note in a diary a few days before the appointment.
- Avoid tracking for long periods (over a week) as it’s not likely to help.

---

## Tests

- Usually not needed to assess apathy.

---

## Further Treatments

- Few specific treatments for apathy itself.
- If related to depression → treatment (therapy or antidepressants) may help.
- If linked to memory/thinking problems → medication such as rivastigmine may help.
- Support groups may be available.
- If impacting daily living → referral to occupational therapy or social services for a Needs Assessment.

---

## Key Messages

- Apathy can be a symptom of Parkinson’s, linked to mood or thinking problems, or happen alone.
- A structured routine, easier choices, and prompts/reminders are important for management.
