# Dizziness

Dizziness is often a difficult symptom to describe. It can also be difficult to work out the cause. People use a range of words to describe how they feel, and the medical terminology is complicated. Symptoms of dizziness can be difficult to distinguish from headaches, visual disturbances, or tiredness.

Although it can be difficult to decide which group dizziness symptoms fit into, there are two main types of dizziness:

- **Vertigo**: a sense of movement when not moving. This is classically described as a spinning sensation but can also be described as feeling like being on a boat or something similar. Vertigo originates in the ear, brain or nerves. These are the parts of the body that detect and interpret where your body is in space in order to maintain balance.
- **Light headedness or feeling faint**: This is often trickier to describe. When oxygen to the brain is reduced, the body’s natural response is to lie down. This is so that the blood doesn’t have to flow against gravity. When blood pressure is very low, the oxygen to the brain is reduced so this same principle applies. The body’s desire to lie down is felt in different ways, for example:
  - Feeling as though your legs give way
  - Feeling off-balance
  - Feeling faint
  - Feeling ‘muzzy’

Many people experience balance problems or falls for other reasons. See the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/balance-and-falls" class="internal-link">_Balance & Falls_</a> page for more information.

## What might be causing it?

Dizziness is a common symptom in people with and without Parkinson’s. The most common reason for dizziness in Parkinson’s is changes in the body’s control of blood pressure. ‘Postural hypotension’ or ‘orthostatic hypotension’ is when the blood pressure drops on changing from a lower position (sitting or lying) to a higher position (standing). This tends to be when people feel the dizziness, though there can be a delay.

Some medications make postural hypotension worse. This includes some Parkinson’s medication, as well as medication for high blood pressure and heart disease. Many other conditions can also cause drops in blood pressure, for example infections, dehydration, and bleeding.

Dizziness can be caused by anxiety or panic. Anxiety is more common in Parkinson’s; see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/mood" class="internal-link">_Mood_</a> page for more information about Anxiety.

Dizziness is seen in a range of other conditions, including inner ear problems (e.g. Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo, BPPV) and people with irregular heartbeats.

Symptoms that are not typical of dizziness related to Parkinson’s include: difficulty in hearing, ringing in your ears (tinnitus) and bad headaches.

## What should I do about it?

There are many lifestyle factors that can improve blood pressure fluctuations and dizziness for those with postural hypotension. Try the suggestions below (see 'What can I try for myself?'). But if the dizziness does not improve or recurs, and is affecting your daily life, you should see your GP. If you have new symptoms with the dizziness, then this should be medically assessed.

Assessment of dizziness is more urgent if it is happening very frequently or causing you to fall or lose consciousness.

## What can I try for myself?

### General

- It is important that you do not stop all activity due to your symptoms. Maintaining activity is really important. You might need to pause and rest if you get dizzy but try to stay active as much as possible.
- Try to reduce your intake of alcohol as this can make all types of dizziness worse.
- Being well rested reduces symptoms of dizziness.
- Maintaining good hydration improves blood pressure control.

### Safety measures

These do not change the symptom but help reduce risks:

- Take your time, especially when you change position. Rushing worsens dizziness and increases the risk of falling.
- Have something to hold when you change position. For example, make sure there is something you can hold on to when you stand up. This will help steady you while your body gets used to being upright.
- Extra support. Consider having someone available to help you in higher risk situations, such as showering or bathing.
- Do not do anything that could be dangerous while you're dizzy. This includes driving, climbing a ladder, and using heavy machinery.
- You must tell DVLA if you have dizziness that is ‘sudden, disabling or recurrent’. See the <a href="[https://www.parkinsons.org.uk](https://www.gov.uk/dizziness-and-driving)" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GOV.UK</a> website for more details.

### Postural hypotension

- Maintaining **good hydration** is essential to maintaining your blood pressure.
- **Avoid triggers.** Situations that will make postural hypotension worse include:
  - Hot stuffy environments, like hot baths or showers
  - Eating large meals
  - Straining (e.g. due to constipation)
  - Standing for long periods of time
- **Moving your legs** before standing can get blood pumping and improve symptoms. If you have to stand for a long time, try shifting the weight between your feet.
- **Flight stockings** – but caution if you have other circulatory problems. If in doubt, speak with your doctor first.
- **Take your time** on changing position: you should allow extra time for your blood pressure to stabilise before walking. For some people this is a few seconds, for others it is many minutes.
- **Raise the head of your bed** by about 15cm (6 inches). You can put bricks or heavy books underneath to lift it or can try using more pillows.
- **Eat small, frequent meals.** Meals with lots of carbohydrates are likely to cause a drop in blood pressure. See Eating Well for guidance on food groups. Sitting still for a while after eating may also help.
- Increased **salt** in the diet may help in some cases, but in some circumstances can be harmful.
  Speak with your GP before you try this.

## Further Assessment

### Questions you may be asked

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- Describe the dizziness (e.g. spinning or lightheadedness)
- Under what circumstances does it happen? Have you noticed any triggers?
- Lifestyle questions (e.g. how much water you drink, alcohol intake)
- Any other symptoms:
  - Difficulty hearing
  - Tinnitus (ringing in ears)
  - Bad headaches or persistent nausea
  - Palpitations
  - Anxiety or panic

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- How best to track your dizziness will depend on how often it is a problem:
  - If it is infrequent, record only when it occurs rather than monitoring it all the time. It is helpful to note what you felt, any other symptoms at the time, and the circumstances (e.g. “Getting out of bed in the morning”).
  - If the dizziness is frequent (daily or multiple times a day) then record what happens over a 3- 5 day period. This could include symptoms, when you take your medication and your food and drink intake, to look for a pattern.

### Tests

- Most of the time blood pressure is checked and no further tests are needed.
- In some cases, more frequent blood pressure monitoring is required.
- Occasionally, depending on your symptoms, further tests may be done. This could include:
  - Blood tests - e.g. to check for anaemia o An ECG (an electrical recording of your heart) o A scan of your head or neck (but this is rare).

## Further Treatments

Your healthcare professional may be able to offer reassurance, advice, or further treatment. The treatment will depend on the cause of the dizziness.

### Cause: Postural Hypotension

- Changes to your medications may help. These changes may be made by your GP or Parkinson’s specialist depending on the situation.
- Managing postural hypotension is challenging if you also have high blood pressure. It can be a delicate balance.
- Some medication may make postural hypotension worse. These should be reviewed and the risks and benefits considered.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- Examples of medication that can sometimes lower blood pressure:
  - Medication used for high blood pressure: alpha blockers (e.g. doxazosin), diuretics (e.g. frusemide, bendroflumethiazide), ACE inhibitors (e.g. Ramipril, enalapril), calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine)
  - Medication used for heart disease: many of the above; beta blockers (e.g. bisoprolol). Note beta blockers are also used for anxiety and for tremor in some cases.
  - Medication used for Parkinson’s: levodopa, dopamine agonists.
  - Medication used for bladder symptoms.
  - Medication used for depression.
- If postural hypotension remains a problem despite lifestyle measures (see above 'What can I try for myself?'), medication may be tried. These are not suitable for everyone. Medication that is sometimes used includes fludrocortisone and midodrine.
- Sometimes special stockings can be fitted that help to support the blood pressure.

### Cause: Vertigo (i.e. inner ear or balance problem)

- A physiotherapist or vestibular specialist may be able to help.
- There may be treatment that is specific to the cause of your vertigo. For example, physical manoeuvres for treatment of BPPV.
- If you are referred on, please be aware there is usually a waiting time before the next service will see you.
