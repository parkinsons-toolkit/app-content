# Saliva and Swallowing Problems 

## Saliva Problems
 
People with Parkinson’s can get problems with their saliva. Sometimes drooling or dribbling can happen. This can cause irritation, infection, or cracks around your mouth. This in turn can make talking, laughing, eating or drinking an issue. 
 
Other people with Parkinson’s may experience dry mouth. This can lead to dental problems, which can be unpleasant and also increase the chance of chest infections. It can feel uncomfortable and make the breath smell. 
  
  
In Parkinson’s, as the movements slow down, so does the natural tendency to swallow. If less saliva is swallowed, it can pool in the mouth and lead to drooling. This may especially happen when people are focussed on doing something else, like a hobby or watching TV. Some people may find it hard to seal their lips or may have a head-down posture, both of which make it harder to control the flow of saliva. 
Other conditions can cause problems with saliva. Either due to excess fluid in the mouth or due to weakness in face muscles. Problems controlling saliva in Parkinson’s tend to occur over time. Sudden new problems are less likely to be Parkinson’s. Allergies or infections (like a cold) can lead to excess fluid. The symptoms tend 
to be mild and short term. Also, drooling tends to happen when asleep. They tend to cause other symptoms too, like sneezing and a runny nose. Weakness of the face can occur for many reasons. 
This includes after a stroke or injury. 
Parkinson's drugs and other drugs can cause a dry mouth. Breathing through the mouth can cause a dry mouth. It can happen when dehydrated from smoking, or after surgery, or injury to the face or neck. 
   
## What should I do about it? 
There are many things you can try for yourself. But if your saliva problems don’t improve within one month and are troublesome, seek help from your GP or talk to your Parkinson’s specialist team. 
If you have white patches in the mouth, or it is painful and red or swollen, see your GP. If you have concerns about tooth decay, gum disease, or infections in the mouth then you should consult a dentist. Make sure to tell them you have Parkinson’s. 
Note if you have new weakness in the face you should see your GP. Very sudden weakness, occurring ‘like the snap of the fingers’, on one side of the body could be a stroke: call for an ambulance, 999. 
   
## What can I try for myself? 
For too much saliva 
Adjustments 
• Changing posture to be more upright 
• Humming while bent over - keeps lips closed and prevents drooling 
 
## Reminders to Swallow 
• Sipping water can help remind you to swallow, and clears your mouth of excess saliva 
• Sugar-free sweets or gum can are helpful reminders to swallow (sugar-free to protect teeth) 
• There are technologies, such as mobile phone apps, to prompt you to swallow. They use vibration or sound alerts. Lip exercises in front of a mirror 
• Close your lips tight for a count of four, relax, and then repeat five times 
• Stretch lips into a wide smile, hold for a count of four, and relax 
• More exercises are available online at Parkinson’s UK o These exercises promote awareness of your lips and remind you to hold lips firmly together to hold saliva in 
 
For dry mouth 
Things you could try: 
• Frequent sips of water during the day 
• Suck on ice cubes and lollies- but only do this if you do not have difficulty swallowing. If you do have difficulties swallowing, sucking on ice cubes could lead to choking. 
• Chew sugar free gum or sugar free sweets 
• Use lip balm if your lips are dry 
• Brush your teeth twice a day and use alcohol-free mouthwash, to reduce the chance of developing tooth decay 
• Some people find humidifiers helpful 
 
Things to avoid: 
• Smoking or chewing tobacco 
• Reduce alcohol, caffeine and fizzy drink intake 
• Alcohol-based mouthwashes 
 
### My Experience 
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences. 
“If I didn’t dribble it would help, but sucking a polo helps. I tried sugary sweets, but that didn’t work very well. It got all sticky.” (Person with Parkinson’s) 
   
Further Assessment 
Questions 
• Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment. 
• See extra information below about things they might ask about. 
   
o Any problems swallowing? o Any coughing or feeling of choking on food, drink or saliva? o Any other changes in your face or mouth, such as a change in your smile? o Any changes in your speech? o Are you persistently thirsty and peeing more often? o Do you have dry eyes? 
 
Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker 
• It is helpful to track your problems with saliva. You can show it to healthcare workers. 
• This might reveal a pattern. Like a particular time of day that this is a problem, or a pattern with your medications. 
• If there is a pattern, tracking your problems and medication for 3 days should reveal it. 

Tests 
• Most people do not need further tests. 
   
### Further Treatments 
Referral 
• You may be referred on to another service. 
• For excess saliva, referral might be to: 
o Speech and language therapists. They may teach you exercises. 
o Physiotherapy or occupational therapy. They may give exercises to help posture or provide equipment. E.g. a tilting chair that allows your head to be upright. o Specialist hospital services for botulinum injections (Botox), into the salivary gland. This procedure carries some small risks, e.g. making the mouth too dry. 
• For dry mouth, referral might be to: 
o Dieticians can give advice on foods to help. 
o Other hospital specialties if a non-Parkinson’s cause is suspected. 
   
Medication 
• Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your drugs. 
Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional. 
   
See extra information about some drugs used for drooling. 
o Glycopyrronium bromide 
o Hyoscine hydrobromide 
o Atropine drops under the tongue 
o Note these are unlicensed to use. 
   
See extra information about drugs that can make drooling worse. 
o Drugs used for mental health problems, such as clozapine. 
o Drugs used for hallucinations and memory problems, e.g. rivastigmine. 
   
See extra information about some drugs used for dry mouth. 
o Artificial saliva: Gels, sprays, tablets or lozenges. They act like saliva (e.g. Aquoral, Biotène Oralbalance gel or Xerotin). Lubricating sprays containing malic acid, physostigmine gel, and saliva substitutes containing citric acid appear to be most effective. Note products with citric acid should be used in conjunction with fluoride products. 
o There is some evidence that herbal products containing chamomile and linseed are effective. 
o There is some evidence that oxygenated glycerol triester (OGT) spray. 
o Products including toothpaste, mouth rinses, gels, lozenges, and sprays containing xylitol appear to be effective and safe 
 
See extra information about some drugs that can make dry mouth worse. 

o Some Parkinson’s drugs, e.g., entacapone, rasagiline, selegiline, and maybe levodopa.  
o Drugs for low mood  
o Drugs for congestion  
o Drugs for allergy  
o Drugs for urinary symptoms (e.g., solifenacin, oxybutynin, tolterodine)  
o Water tablets (e.g., furosemide)  

Note: research does not support the effectiveness of acupuncture or electrostimulation for dry mouth.  

Key Messages  
• Parkinson’s may cause too much saliva, or not enough saliva.  
• There are things you can try for both of these.  
• Saliva problems in Parkinson’s get worse over time. Sudden problems with saliva are likely due to another cause.

# Swallowing Difficulties

## Introduction
Some people with Parkinson’s have trouble with swallowing or eating. It can be more difficult to swallow certain foods, drinks, and medications. Your swallowing can be affected in different ways:  
- Difficulty keeping food or drink in your mouth  
- Difficulty swallowing food in one go, causing food to remain in your mouth  
- Chewing food more slowly  
- Trouble opening your mouth  
- Coughing or clearing your throat when you are eating or drinking  
- Feeling like food is getting stuck as it goes down to your stomach  

Swallowing problems range from mild to severe and can happen at any time. If you notice any swallowing difficulties, it is important to speak with your GP or Parkinson's specialist team. They can refer you to specialists for treatment. Untreated swallowing problems can cause more serious health conditions, such as chest infections.

## What might be causing it?
The slowing and stiffening of muscles in Parkinson’s can contribute to swallowing problems. Muscles involved in chewing and swallowing (e.g., muscles in the face, jaw, tongue, and throat) can become less efficient and powerful. People with Parkinson’s can experience dry mouth, tiredness, or difficulties concentrating at meal times, all of which can make swallowing more challenging.  

Problems moving your arm or hand (e.g., due to tremor) can also make it harder to guide food into your mouth.  

Other medical issues can cause swallowing difficulties, including:  
- Weakness in muscles of the face or throat  
- Blockages or narrowing of the throat or gullet  
- Poor fitting dentures, and tooth or gum health issues  

Swallowing difficulties in Parkinson’s tend to develop gradually. Sudden problems are likely related to other causes. A professional assessment is often needed to identify the root cause.

## What should I do about it?
There are things you can try to make swallowing easier. However, it is very important to tell your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team if you have difficulty swallowing food, drinks, or medication. Swallowing problems can increase the risk of more serious problems, like choking or chest infections.  

If you have new weakness in your face, consult your GP. Very sudden weakness on one side of the body could indicate a stroke—call 999 for an ambulance if this occurs.

## What can I try for myself?

### Planning ahead
- Plan meals for when your medication is working  
- Plan meals for when you are less tired—this may mean moving your main meal to lunchtime  
- If you wear dentures, make sure they fit comfortably; see your dentist if needed  

### Medication adjustments
If medications feel like they are getting stuck, talk with your Parkinson’s specialist team and/or pharmacist. There may be a version available that is easier to swallow:  
- Some pills can be split in half, crushed, sprinkled on yoghurt, or dissolved in the mouth  
- Anything that is “XR” (extended release) or “CR” (continuous release) should not be crushed  
- Always check with your specialist team or pharmacist before altering tablets  

### Meal adjustments
- Smaller, more frequent meals and snacks  
- Softer foods (e.g., mashed potatoes, bananas)  
- Heated plates to keep food warm longer  
- Smaller portions and reheat a second portion if needed  

### While eating
- Take your time and eat in a quiet, comfortable place without distractions  
- Try smaller mouthfuls  
- Avoid taking another mouthful until you’ve cleared your mouth and throat  

### Drinking
- A speech and language therapist can suggest a suitable straw to reduce the risk of liquids going down the wrong pipe  
- Refill your cup or glass when it’s half empty to avoid tilting your head back  
- Very cold liquids can encourage swallowing; try drinking them first thing or with meals  

### Swallowing tip
Follow this step-by-step process:  
1. Take a small mouthful of food or drink  
2. Close your lips  
3. Chew well  
4. Take a deliberate swallow, squeezing all muscles in your mouth and throat  
5. Swallow again to ensure all food/drink has gone  
6. Lick around the mouth with your tongue to check all food has gone  
7. Repeat until finished eating or drinking  

## My Experience
> “Things like chilli con carne, spaghetti Bolognese because they’re not big pieces of meat. But like if he’s got a chicken breast and when you cut things up … sloppier foods are obviously better than, you know, chunky foods.”  
> — Carer of someone with Parkinson’s  

## Further Assessment

### Questions
Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions. Consider recording your answers in your “My Health” section to bring to your appointment. They might ask:  
- Are you having problems swallowing food, liquids, or tablets (or a combination)?  
- Have you had any unintentional weight loss?  
- Do you have pain when swallowing?  
- Has your voice changed?  
- Do you have heartburn, nausea, or vomiting?  

### Track your symptoms
Tracking your symptoms can help identify patterns and support discussions with healthcare professionals.  

# Activity Tracker and Further Management of Swallowing Difficulties

## Activity Tracker
- It can be helpful to track your swallowing problems for 3 days to show healthcare professionals. This helps them identify patterns.  
- Record the following:  
  - When swallowing difficulties occur  
  - Types of foods or drinks that are difficult to swallow  
  - Any other issues related to swallowing  
  - Timing of your medications  

## Tests
- Most cases do not require further tests.  
- If needed, your healthcare professional may recommend:  
  - Blood tests  
  - Camera tests to examine your food pipe (endoscopy)  

## Further Treatments

### Medication
- Swallowing difficulties may worsen when Parkinson's medication has worn off. Adjustments to your medication regimen may help—discuss this with your Parkinson’s specialist team.  
- Sedating medications can make swallowing problems worse.  
- **Do not change your medication regime without consulting a healthcare professional.**  

### Referral to Other Services
You may be referred to specialist services depending on your assessment:  
- **Speech and Language Therapists** – Assess swallowing, teach techniques and exercises, advise on food consistency, and recommend suitable straws.  
- **Occupational Therapists** – Provide equipment to assist with eating and drinking.  
- **Dieticians** – Support people who are underweight and advise on diet adjustments.  
- **Physiotherapists** – Help with posture while eating.  
- **Hospital Specialties** – Ear, Nose, and Throat specialists or Gastroenterologists if a non-Parkinson’s cause is suspected.  

If you are experiencing significant and progressive difficulties swallowing, see the *Progression of Symptoms* page for further information.  

## Key Messages
- Problems with swallowing tablets, liquids, or food can occur at any stage of Parkinson’s.  
- Speak with your GP or healthcare professional as soon as you notice swallowing difficulties or if they worsen significantly. Early assessment may prevent more serious complications.
