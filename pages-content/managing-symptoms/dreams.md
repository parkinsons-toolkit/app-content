# Dream Disturbance

Many people with Parkinson’s experience vivid dreams. For some this is no problem, but for others it can cause distress or disrupt sleep. This can impact how you feel in the daytime. Movement changes during dreams are also a symptom of Parkinson’s.

Dreams occur during a phase of sleep known as Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. This is named this way because the eyes move very fast during this phase. A key feature of this phase is that the body does <ins>not</ins> move. Some people with sleep problems lose this unconscious control over movement during sleep, and so they “act out” their dreams. This is called REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder (RBD). This ranges from gesturing, jerking and talking to thrashing around, shouting and walking. This is closely related to Parkinson’s. However not all people with Parkinson’s have RBD and not all people with RBD have Parkinson’s.

Sometimes the difference between vivid dreams and being awake can become a bit unclear. See our <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/hallucinations" class="internal-link">_Hallucinations_</a> page for more information on seeing things that aren’t there when awake.

## What might be causing it?

Vivid dreams experienced by a person with Parkinson’s are most likely caused by the Parkinson’s itself.

**Factors that can make vidid dreams worse include:**

- Some medications
- Stress, trauma and anxiety
- Changes to your sleep schedule (for example from jetlag)
- Insomnia (difficulty getting to or staying asleep)
- Alcohol and illicit drug use, or withdrawal from them

**Vivid dreams are also more common in:**

- People with some mental health problems (such as depression and schizophrenia).
- Those with other sleep disorders (such as narcolepsy).
- Those with other physical illnesses (such as heart disease).
- Early pregnancy.

As with vivid dreams, RBD in someone with Parkinson’s is most likely caused by the condition itself. In people who do not have a diagnosis of Parkinson’s it is more common in men than women, and also occurs more frequently in people with sleep disorders (e.g. narcolepsy), those taking certain medication, and those withdrawing from medication or alcohol after developing a dependency.

## What should I do about it?

Vivid dreams don’t require any treatment if they are not causing distress. However, if they are causing distress then some lifestyle changes can help. Also dealing with any factors that make it happen or make it worse (such as anxiety) can help.

RBD exists across a range of severity and so the most important thing to consider is safety. Is there risk of injury to yourself or others from movements made during sleep? Features that would be a cause for concern are violent movements, falling from bed, or walking beyond the bedspace. These features would make it an urgent issue to address. If this is the case your Parkinson’s specialist team would be the preferred people to contact. If the movements are not as marked as this then it is not urgent, but you should still discuss it with your Parkinson’s specialist team or GP.

## What can I try for myself?

**Lifestyle changes thought to improve sleep and reduce dream disturbances:**

- Eating well and keeping well hydrated.
- Optimising physical and mental health (see the _Optimising Wellbeing_ pages found in the <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons" class="internal-link">_Living with Parkinson's_</a> section for advice).
- Keep a regular sleep schedule (see the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/sleep" class="internal-link">_Sleep Disturbances_</a> page for more detail).
- Tackle stress and anxiety (see <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/dealing-with-stress-and-challenges" class="internal-link">_Dealing with Stress and Challenges_</a> and <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/mood" class="internal-link">_Mood_</a> pages).

**If you are acting out dreams, consider the safety of yourself and your bed partner:**

- Remove sharp or breakable objects or furniture from near the bedside.
- Consider putting cushions or pillows beside the bed.
- Would a lower bed or mattress on the floor be safer?
- Would a separate bed or room be preferable for your bed partner?

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- What is the disturbance you experience
- Your sleep pattern
- Lifestyle factors
- Mood symptoms and other disturbances such as whether you experience hallucinations
- Risks, e.g. falling out of bed, and impact of the symptoms
- Your medication

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- For dream disturbances you could monitor your sleep pattern, when the dream problems occur and your medication. The length of time monitoring will depend on how often the dream problems are occurring. It is best to capture at least three occasions to look for patterns.

### Tests

Tests are rarely needed but sometimes ‘sleep studies’ are run. This may involve a short hospital stay to have sleep monitored.

## Further Treatments

Having consulted a healthcare professional, they may offer reassurance, advice or further treatment.

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurse) may change your medication if it’s within their expertise.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**

**Medication used for dream disturbances:**

- Clonazepam
- Melatonin

**Medications that may affect your dreams:**

- Medications for depression and anxiety, including mirtazapine and SSRIs (e.g. citalopram, sertraline) can worsen RBD. Speak to your healthcare professional before changing your medication.

## Key Messages

- Some people with Parkinson’s experience more vivid dreams, calling out or acting out dreams.
- It is important to address any safety concerns. You should talk to your Parkinson’s specialist team if you experience these symptoms.
