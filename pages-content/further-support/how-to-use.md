## How to Personalise

There are personalised sections (About Me, My Health, Symptom Review, My Well-being, My Tracker, Appointments and To Do Lists & Notes) which each aim to...

You might find it useful to consider what types of questions could help you to analyse the data you’ve entered into the tracker. For example:

- At what times of the day am I usually available to start a new exercise or activity?
- How do I typically feel after regularly completing a specific activity?
- What do I hope to learn from tracking this data, and how long do I plan to continue recording it?
- Is there a pattern between when I take specific medication and how I feel or notice certain symptoms?

Here are some questions you might explore by entering data into the tracker:

- “_At what times of the day are my symptoms less severe?_”
- “_When does my medication wear off, am I taking it on time?_”
- “_On which days and at what times am I available to start a new habit?_”
- “_How many hours do I spend on a particular activity?_”

_**Tip 1:** Setting reminders can also be helpful. You might want to set monthly, 6-monthly, or pre-appointment reminders to look back at the toolkit and the data you have entered, such as using the symptom review section. For example, you can set a calendar reminder to log in to the toolkit regularly._

_**Tip 2:** It can be helpful to complete the symptom review section ahead of your appointments to help you reflect on your experiences and decide what you might like to focus on. You could even set calendar email reminders to complete this section in advance and print the pages to bring to your appointment._

Each section of the tracker has its own dedicated video tutorial to help you navigate and get the most out of the tracker (see below).

## Self-Management

### What is self-management, and why is it important?

Self-management means increasing your knowledge, skills and confidence to manage your own health and care. This includes learning and developing skills about how you can manage Parkinson’s, making informed and conscious choices on what is right for you and working with your healthcare team.

### Why focus on self-management?

How can becoming empowered help you self-manage?

Benefits of Self-Management:

- Understanding your condition can empower you to ask questions and be more involved in making decisions about your health.
- Helps you to monitor your condition, know when to get help and who to speak to. This can give you a greater sense of control and cut down your appointments.

## Making Changes & Keeping on Track

Although everyone’s condition and circumstances are different, everyone has ups and downs. This can make it hard to ‘follow a plan’. There are different ways to approach this difficulty.

Tips to consider:

1. **Think about what is important to you:** Focus on things that are important to you to keep you motivated.
2. **Break it down:** If a task or ambition feels big, break it down into a series of smaller steps.
3. **Set a realistic target or aim:** This is like making a New Year resolution. It should be specific and something you can achieve, so that you feel encouraged when you meet it.
4. **Work with your body:** Try to use the good times and don’t be too hard on yourself during the difficult times. If symptoms are getting in the way, read the symptom pages for tips on managing them.
5. **Record progress:** Some people find it helpful to keep a log of what they are doing.

- You could add your planned actions in <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders & Notes_</a> and check it off when completed.
- You could enter your activities to the <a href="/learn/my-tracker" class="internal-link">_My Tracker_</a> to keep a record.
  This can also help you see which times are better for you than others.

6. **Reflect:** If something is not going as you’d hoped, think about why. What could you do differently? You might need to break it down into even smaller steps to make progress.
7. **Reward:** If it’s going well, reward yourself.
8. **Forming a habit:** If you want to do something on a regular basis, you want to make it automatic, like a habit. This takes persistence over time. For most people it takes about 3months for a regular activity to become a habit. To help:

- You could try associating the task with something that is already part of your routine, like brushing your teeth, or watching a scheduled TV programme. This gives an anchor.

The <a href="/learn/my-wellbeing" class="internal-link">_My Wellbeing_</a> section in your manual will guide you through this process.
