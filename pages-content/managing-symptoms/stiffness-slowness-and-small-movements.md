# Stiffness, Slowness & Small Movements

Stiffness or _rigidity_ is generally felt in the muscles of the body. Muscles don’t stretch or relax as they usually do. This can cause feelings of pain or tightness in people’s muscles. People with Parkinson’s may notice they have difficulty with small movements of their hands. This may be when buttoning buttons, shaving their face or writing with a pen. They may also have trouble rolling over in bed or getting out of a chair. Facial muscles may also be stiff, and a person with Parkinson’s may have less facial expression than they used to. 
 
Slowness of movement also happens in Parkinson’s. This can be seen in someone’s overall movements being slower, for example, their walking or gestures. Repeated movements can also become smaller or slower the more the actions are repeated. This can happen when doing a lot of writing by hand, for example. People with Parkinson’s can also have slower reaction times or take smaller and more shuffling steps. Stiffness, slowness and difficulty with small movements may also contribute to falls and pain.

# What might be causing it?
In Parkinson’s, the movement symptoms of the condition are caused mainly by having reduced levels of dopamine in the brain. Movement symptoms are otherwise known as motor symptoms and include stiffness, slowness, and tremor. Although Parkinson’s medications do not slow down the progression of the condition, in many cases they can help reduce the frequency and severity of these symptoms. 
 
Some people with Parkinson’s develop a _frozen shoulder_, often before they have been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. This is stiffness, pain and a reduced range of movement in the shoulder. 
 
Stiffness can also occur with other medical conditions. The most common non-Parkinson’s cause is osteoarthritis. Other problems in the joints, bones or muscles can also cause stiffness. It can sometimes be complicated to sort out what stiffness is related to Parkinson’s and what may be due to another health issue. If the symptom changes in response to Parkinson’s medication, then it is more likely that it is being caused by Parkinson’s. 
 
Slow movements can be the result of other problems too – for example due to pain, tiredness, low mood or slowed thinking. These can be in relation to Parkinson’s or a separate issue.

# What should I do about it?
There are many things you can try for yourself as described below. Although there are some circumstances where you should seek professional help. If you are having problems turning over in bed, getting dressed, or walking, it is time to speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. Similarly, if stiffness and slowness are bothering you, and you don’t see improvement by one month of following the advice below, seek help from your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.

# What can I try for myself?

### Activity
There are 2 aspects to this:
1. Undertaking Activity: This can help lengthen and stretch muscles and reduces the impact of movement changes over time. The type of activity depends on your personal circumstances. Doing exercise regularly is important for everyone.
2. Reducing periods of sitting: e.g. Walking breaks during the day to break up periods of sitting still.

See <a href="/learn/living-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/keeping-active" class="internal-link">_Keeping Active_</a> section for more tips about activities. Ideally these are tailored for you by a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. Here are a few specific tips for symptoms of stiffness, slowness and smaller movements. None of these should be painful. If you experience pain, talk to your physiotherapist, GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. 

### Big Movements
- Movements may get smaller with Parkinson’s.
- Giving attention to this can overcome it.
- Think about the size of movements as you do them, e.g. _think_ about big steps.
- Practice tasks, focusing on the size of the movements.

### Stretches
- Stretching should feel like a gentle pull on the muscle, not be painful.
- Hold each stretch for 10-30 seconds, keeping it still and steady.
- Breathe slowly in and out during the stretch. Don’t hold your breath.
- Repeat each stretch 3-4 times, with a brief break between.
- Work through the different parts of the body.
- Try to make this a routine part of your life, several times per week. 

### Shoulder movements
- To help keep the shoulders moving well, give them specific attention
- During your time stretching, include some shoulder movements:
  - Shrug your shoulders up toward your ears and back down again
  - Roll the shoulders in circles (forwards and backwards)
  - Move your shoulders backwards (‘retraction’) like you are pulling your shoulder blades together
- Exaggerate the movements, trying to make them as big as possible. 

### Hand movements
- Dexterity can be affected by Parkinson’s.
- Exercises ideally include a range of functions:
  - Practicing control of force, i.e. grip of small objects.
  - Practicing moving the fingers one at a time.
  - Practicing coordinating finger movements, i.e. which fingers move together or separately, and the timing of  movements.
- There are many different ways of, for example:
  - Writing or drawing tasks o Handling small objects, like turning coins, or screwing nuts onto bolts.
  - Modelling with clay or playdough.
 
### Warm baths
- May help relax stiff muscles.
- _Make sure you are well hydrated if you have warm baths._
