# **Sexual Problems in Parkinson’s**

Sexual difficulties are common but not universal. They can be **physical, emotional, or psychological**, and can include:

* Reduced sexual desire (libido)
* Difficulty with arousal or orgasm
* Pain during sex (especially in women after menopause)
* Movement-related challenges during sexual activity
* Hypersexuality (increased sexual desire or behavior, sometimes caused by certain medications like dopamine agonists)

## **Causes**

Sexual difficulties may arise from:

1. **Normal aging**

   * Reduced lubrication in women post-menopause
   * Erectile difficulties in men

2. **Medical conditions**

   * Diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, pelvic problems

3. **Parkinson’s effects**

   * Slowed or uncoordinated movements
   * Fatigue or tiredness
   * Bladder/bowel problems
   * Psychological impacts (stress, depression, reduced confidence)
   * Medication side effects

## **When to Seek Help**

* Persistent or worsening sexual problems
* Out-of-character hypersexuality (urgent consultation with your Parkinson’s specialist)

## **Self-Help Strategies**

**Movement-related issues:**

* Try different sexual positions for comfort

**Fatigue:**

## **Professional Support**

* **Pelvic floor physiotherapists:** guidance on exercises
* **Medication adjustments:** Parkinson’s drugs or other medications may be modified if contributing to sexual issues

If you want, I can also make a **simple table of “problem → potential cause → practical solution”** specifically for Parkinson’s-related sexual issues. It’s very handy for reference. Do you want me to do that?
