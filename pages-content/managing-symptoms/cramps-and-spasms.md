Dystonia is an involuntary muscle contraction (this is different to **Dyskinesia** which refers to <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/involuntary-movements" class="internal-link">_Involuntary Movements_</a>). Dystonia is caused by incorrect brain signals. Muscles become tighter or shorter than usual, making them stiff. Dystonia can involve twisting movements or spasms. Dystonia can feel painful or uncomfortable. Not everyone who has Parkinson’s will experience it.

Dystonia most commonly effects the legs and feet of someone with Parkinson’s. It can cause abnormal postures of limbs or digits. People may notice their toes curling. They may notice their feet turning in at the ankle. They may feel or see their big toe sticking up. Dystonia can also impact the eyelids. It can cause frequent blinking and an intolerance to light. It can affect the head and neck, the vocal cords, and/or the hands.

## What might be causing it?

Most people with Parkinson’s who experience dystonia have ‘secondary’ dystonia. This means they get it as a symptom of their condition or as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medication. ‘Primary’ dystonia is a genetic condition in people without Parkinson’s. This runs in families.

Some people with Parkinson’s notice dystonia when their medication levels are low. This may be at the end of the day, or in between doses. It could be early in the morning before they have taken any medications. They may have dystonia when their medication levels are at the highest in their bodies, but this is less common.

## What should I do about it?

There are various strategies you can try for yourself discussed below. You should also routinely talk to your Parkinson’s specialist team about these symptoms. They may be able to make medication adjustments to help. If the symptoms are causing difficulties with daily life or sleep, then you may need to speak to the team sooner.

## What can I try for myself?

- Some people find pressure, warm compresses or stretching help.
- Some people discover ‘sensory tricks.’ This is touching the affected area or a nearby area of the body. It can reduce the length or severity of the contraction.
- Relaxing techniques like a warm bath, yoga, or massage may help.
- Eyelid dystonia is also called blepharospasm. It may respond to: pressure on the eyebrows, lying down, or chewing.

### Stretching

- It is best to be guided by your physiotherapist about specific stretches.
- Stretching should feel like a gentle pull on the muscle, not be painful. If you experience pain, speak to your physiotherapist, GP or Parkinson’s specialist team.
- Work through the different parts of the body. You may wish to pay particular attention to the parts of the body where you get cramps or spasms.
- Hold each stretch for 10-30 seconds, keeping it still and steady.
- Breathe slowly in and out during the stretch. Don’t hold your breath.
- Repeat each stretch 3-4 times, with a brief break between.
- Try to make this a routine part of your life, several times per week.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> _“Sometimes I do, I know when the muscles and everything get stiffer, and what I do, I just massage myself.”_
>
> _(Carer for someone with Parkinson’s)_

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/information/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

**They may ask about:**

- Describe what you experience
- When does it happen?
- Is the problem affected by your Parkinson’s medication?
- How does it impact on your daily activities or sleep?
- Does anything help it / make it worse?

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help the professional identify patterns. It may influence medication adjustments. Bring your record to your specialist appointment.
- You could record when the dystonia happens, if you are ‘on’ or ‘off’ when you experience dystonia, and when you have taken your medication.
- Usually 3-5 days of tracking will be enough to see patterns.

### Tests

Tests are rarely required for dystonia.

## Further Treatments

### Medication

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication. Nurses may do this if it is within their expertise.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional first.**
- Changing treatment to manage dystonia may be needed. It will generally be advised by your Parkinson’s Specialist team.

Possible adjustments that may be considered:

- Longer-acting medications.
- Adjusting medication schedule to smaller, more frequent doses.
- Dissolving medications that have a quicker ‘on’ effect. This can help in the morning, if this is when dystonia is most difficult.
- Non-Parkinson’s medications may also be considered.

### Referral

- You may be referred on to another service. Please be aware there is usually a waiting time before that next service can see you.
- You may be referred to a physiotherapist. They will address movement problems more broadly.
- Sometimes people with severe cramps or spasms are referred to a specialist team. This can be for more invasive treatments
  - **Botulinum toxin (Botox)** injections may be considered with a specialist. This is to relax muscle groups that are moving excessively.
  - **Deep brain stimulation (DBS)** may also be an option for some patients. See <a href="/information/treatments-and-therapies/advanced-therapies-and-surgical-treatments" class="internal-link">Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments</a> Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments for more information.
