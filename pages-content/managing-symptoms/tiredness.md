# Tiredness and Fatigue in Parkinson’s

## Understanding the Difference

- **Tiredness**: Occasional, often obvious cause (e.g., poor sleep). Usually relieved by rest.  
- **Fatigue**: More persistent and overwhelming. Can affect energy, mood, and daily activity. May last a long time and significantly impact life.  

**Note:** Up to **50% of people with Parkinson’s** experience fatigue. Its exact cause is unknown, but multiple factors can contribute.

**Daytime sleepiness** refers to feeling like you might fall asleep during the day.

## Causes

- **Parkinson’s itself** can cause fatigue and sleepiness. Fatigue may appear early in the disease.  
- **Medication effects**: Some Parkinson’s drugs can cause sleepiness, especially as doses wear off.  
- **Other causes**: Stress, low mood, poor sleep, anemia, diabetes, thyroid problems.  
- **Sudden, extreme tiredness** may indicate another illness (e.g., infection).

### Daily Life
- Identify tiring activities and triggers to avoid them.  
- **Pace yourself**: Prioritize tasks; break bigger tasks into manageable steps.  
- Be realistic: not everything needs to be done today.

### At Work
- Take regular breaks.  
- Discuss adjustments with your employer (see Work & Caring guidance).

### At Home
- Pace activities; take breaks when tired.  
- Schedule important tasks when energy is higher.  
- Accept help when needed.

### Napping
- Short naps (20–30 minutes) after meals may reduce fatigue.  
- Avoid excessive napping, which can disrupt night sleep.  
- Lighter meals may help if fatigue occurs after eating.

### Exercise
- Helps combat fatigue, improves mood, sleep, and general health.  
- Do what you can manage—even chair-based exercises count.  
- Plan exercise for times of higher energy if fatigue follows a pattern.

### Healthy Body and Mind
- Keep mentally active with hobbies or enjoyable activities.  
- Eat a balanced diet and small snacks to maintain energy.  
- Limit alcohol to improve sleep quality.  
- Multivitamins or “tonics” are unnecessary if diet is healthy.  
- See Sleep Difficulties page for advice on improving sleep.

# Further Treatments for Tiredness and Fatigue in Parkinson’s

## Medication Management

- **Do not change your medication** without consulting a healthcare professional.  
- Doctors (GPs or neurologists) and senior nurses (e.g., Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may adjust your drugs based on your symptoms.  

### Possible Approaches
- If **sleepiness is due to medications**, your doctor may adjust or change them.  
- If **tiredness is due to Parkinson’s medication wearing off**, the regime may be modified to give longer coverage.  
- **Modafinil** may be used for severe daytime sleepiness but is **only prescribed by specialists** and requires regular review.  
- If **tiredness is related to low mood or sleep problems**, treatment for these underlying causes may be recommended.  

### Medications That Can Worsen Tiredness
- Dopamine agonists (e.g., Mirapex®, Requip®) – may be reduced or switched  
- Opiate painkillers (e.g., codeine, morphine)  
- Allergy medications (e.g., Piriton)  
- Relaxants – benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam)  
- Some antidepressants (e.g., mirtazapine)  
- Some pain medications (e.g., amitriptyline)  
- Some heart/blood pressure medications (e.g., beta blockers like atenolol)  
- Some anti-seizure medications (e.g., phenytoin, clonazepam)  
- Some cancer treatments  

**Important:** Combining these medications with alcohol can significantly increase drowsiness.
