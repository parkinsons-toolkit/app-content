# Information, Websites & Apps for Parkinson’s

When diagnosed with Parkinson’s, seeking additional information beyond what your healthcare professionals provide can help you better understand the condition and manage symptoms. Information can be found on the **internet, apps, books, libraries, support groups, and organisations** like Citizens Advice. It can be overwhelming, and sometimes contradictory, so always discuss new information with your GP or healthcare team.
