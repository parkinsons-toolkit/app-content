Skin conditions affect many people across the population.

Conditions that can be more common in people with Parkinson’s are:

- Oily skin.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis: areas of the skin become red, itchy, and sore. The skin can peel or flake and can develop thick crusts or scales.
- Wounds or ulcers from delayed healing or from pressure on a particular part of the body.
- Abnormal moles.

---

## What might be causing it?

### Oily Skin

- The skin produces an oily substance called sebum, which protects the skin and keeps it supple.
- People with Parkinson’s may produce more sebum than normal, which can make the face and
  scalp oily and shiny.

### Seborrhoeic Dermatitis

- No one knows for sure what causes seborrheic dermatitis, but it’s thought that a type of yeast found on the skin may play a part.
- It is not caused by poor personal hygiene.
- It is not known for sure why seborrheic dermatitis is more common in people with Parkinson’s. It may be that people with Parkinson’s produce more sebum than normal.
- Seborrhoeic dermatitis is more common in men overall. This is likely a result of male hormones increasing sebum production.

### Wounds & Ulcers

- People with Parkinson’s can have ‘peripheral neuropathy’. This causes decreased sensation in the extremities. See the <a href="/information/managing-symptoms/five-senses" class="internal-link">_5 Senses_</a> page for more information.
- Decreased sensation may mean an injury, or infection in a body part like the foot takes longer to detect.
- Healing from an injury may take longer with age, poor nutrition, or other health conditions.

Prolonged pressure through an area of skin can cause damage. This is more likely in people who find moving around difficult.

### Abnormal Moles & Parkinson’s

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/parkinsons-toolkit/app-content/refs/heads/dev/images/checking-moles.jpg" alt="checking-moles" class="skin-conditions__checking-moles">

- Some research studies have shown that people with Parkinson’s have a slightly higher risk of developing abnormal moles or melanoma. People with melanoma have a greater risk of developing Parkinson’s.
- The exact link has not been discovered, just a connection between the two for now.
- Melanoma is a type of skin cancer. One of the main causes of melanoma is exposure to too much ultraviolet light in sunlight. About 16,000 people in the UK are diagnosed with melanoma each year. There is more information available on the <a href="www.nhs.uk/conditions/melanoma-skin-cancer" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_NHS website_</a>.

All of these skin issues are seen in people who don’t have Parkinson’s as well. And people with Parkinson’s can also get skin conditions that are completely unrelated to their Parkinson’s. Wounds and ulcers are more common in people who have decreased sensation for other medical reasons. An example of this would be those with diabetes.

There are many things you can try for yourself as below, but there are some circumstances where you should seek professional help.

Make a GP appointment as soon as possible if:

- You have an area of your skin with a wound that isn’t healing properly.
- You have a crusting or roughened spot/raised area or rash that isn’t healing or is getting larger.
- You have a mole that concerns you or has recently changed. Features to look out for are: large size (5mm or more in diameter), irregular edges, multi-coloured, changing, or is asymmetric – for example is lop-sided.

The other skin conditions discussed here are not urgent, but if bothering you then make a routine GP appointment.

### Seborrhoeic Dermatitis

- Wash your hair and beard with ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulphide, or coal tar shampoo. These are available from local pharmacies. See the below the ‘Further treatments’ for other treatments.
- For hard-to-remove crusts or scales on the scalp and/or beard:
  - Rub olive or mineral oil into the affected area a few hours before washing.
  - Or use a de-scaling agent containing ketoconazole, salicylic acid, selenium sulphide, or coal tar. These are available from local pharmacies.
- For scalp and/or beard maintenance: shampoos containing tea tree oil used regularly may be helpful.
- For eyelids: Clean them daily with cotton buds moistened with baby shampoo.
- Avoid irritants on face and body.

### Oily Skin

- Wash your face with a mild soap twice daily in warm water and rinse in cool water.
- If you use make-up and moisturisers:
  - Try using water-based gels instead of oil-based creams.
  - Avoid cosmetic products that contain alcohol, or that irritate your skin.
- Speak to your pharmacist or GP for more advice on suitable products.

### Wounds & Ulcers

- Keep skin clean and dry: particular attention is needed for skin folds and between the toes.
- Check the entire body for any wounds. This is especially in areas of the body with decreased sensation: o Check to make sure the skin is intact.
  - If there are any spots where skin has broken down, continue to regularly check any small injuries for healing or infection.
  - Pain, bad smell, fluid leakage, swelling, or increasing size are all signs that a wound is not healing properly.
- Change your position regularly in chairs and in bed. This is so that you are not in the same position for many hours per day:
  - Staying in the same position can lead to pressure ulcers. These are wounds from pressure being applied to the same area of the body.

### Abnormal Moles

Check moles regularly (monthly), looking for any changes. You can ask someone else to check or photograph moles on your back.

- You should be particularly careful if you have:
  - Had a lot of sun exposure or sun burn in your life.
  - A lot of moles or freckles.
  - A skin type that does not tan easily.
  - Red or blonde hair and/or blue eyes.
  - A close relative has had melanoma.
- Features to look out for in your moles are:

  - Larger size (More than 5mm diameter)
  - Irregular edges
  - Multi-coloured
  - Asymmetric (lop-sided)
  - Changing

- If a mole is changing or you have any concerns about its appearance it should be reviewed by your GP. If you are not sure if a mole is changing, you could take a photo of it for comparison.
- Be careful with sun exposure. Some sun exposure is good and helps your body make vitamin D. However, too much sun exposure increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancer. Finding the balance can be tricky. There is no definitive recommendation for the amount of time that should be spent in the sun.
- See the <a href="/learnliving-with-parkinsons/optimising-wellbeing/eating-well" class="internal-link">_Eating Well_</a> page for dietary information about Vitamin D.

- Safe sun exposure:

  - Even if it is cool or cloudy, it is possible to get a sunburn.
    - Do not rely on sunscreen alone to protect yourself getting sun damage. Wear suitable clothing and spend time in the shade when the sun's at its hottest. This is 11am to 3pm in the UK from March to October.
  - There is no safe or healthy way to get a tan from sunlight.
  - Getting a tan provides little protection against later exposure to sunlight. The resulting skin damage outweighs any later protective effect.
  - Windows block some of the sunlight. Sunlight shining through a window pane will not be enough for your body to make vitamin D.
  - It is not possible to get enough vitamin D from sunlight between October and March in the UK.
  - For more guidance on safe sun exposure, visit the <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/seasonal-health/sunscreen-and-sun-safety/" class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NHS Sunscreen and Sun Safety</a> page.

- Sun protection: this can be achieved by covering skin with clothing, seeking shade and applying sunscreen. Sunscreen is an additional protection rather than an alternative to covering up
  - Sunscreen must be applied liberally, carefully and repeatedly on exposed skin.
  - UVA in a circle logo indicates that a sunscreen meets the minimum standards for UVA protection. You should use a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 to protect against UVB.

## Further Assessment

### Questions

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/information/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.

The questions will relate to your particular skin issue. They will generally cover details about what the problem is, when it occurred, how it has changed over time, whether you’ve had it before and what you have tried.

_**Track your symptoms in the <a href="/my-tracker" class="internal-link">My Tracker</a>:**_

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.
- For skin issues you could record when you notice an issue. Also note the details of it. Then check again a few weeks later and see if it has changed.

### Tests

Depending on their assessment, sometimes further tests are needed. For some skin conditions the test is a biopsy. This is where a sample of the skin or mole is taken to examine it under a microscope.

## Further Treatments

### Medication

- Your GP or pharmacist may be able to recommend medicated creams or shampoos for seborrheic dermatitis if needed. Many of these are available both on prescription and over the counter.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**

**Medicinal products that may be recommended for seborrheic dermatitis:**

- For skin (face, body, scalp): ketoconazole cream, mild steroid cream, or creams with a combination of anti-fungal medicine and steroid. Note these should only be used short term.
- For hair (head or beard): ketoconazole shampoo, and selenium sulphide shampoo.
- If a wound is thought to be infected, you may require antibiotics.

### Referral

You may be referred on to another service.

If skin cancer is suspected, you will be referred to a skin specialist: a dermatologist. The appointment should be within a couple of weeks.

- Severe uncontrolled seborrheic dermatitis or where your doctor is uncertain about the diagnosis sometimes warrants referral to a dermatologist.
- Long term wounds may require regular nursing review. This will either via your GP practice nurse or the district nursing services if you are unable to get to appointments.

## Key Messages

- People with Parkinson’s may have skin conditions that can be common in people without Parkinson’s too.
- Skin issues that are more common in Parkinson’s include: oily skin, seborrheic dermatitis, wounds & ulcers, and abnormal moles.
- If you have decreased feeling or sensation in any area of your body, be sure to check there regularly (every time you bathe) for any cuts or wounds that aren’t healing properly.
