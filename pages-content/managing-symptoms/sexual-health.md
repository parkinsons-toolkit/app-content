# Sexual Function
Sexual problems can happen with Parkinson’s, but not everyone will experience these. Some people notice changes physically, emotionally, or with sexual drive.

Many people do not feel comfortable talking about sex, meaning sexual problems may be missed and not addressed.

## What Might Be Causing It?
At times, it is completely normal to have issues with sex. Different factors can influence it, including tiredness and mood. Normal ageing also causes physical changes that affect the ability to have or enjoy sex. After the menopause women have lower oestrogen levels. This can cause less lubrication and sometimes the lining of the vagina can become sensitive or inflamed. This can make sex painful. Health conditions and medicines can affect sexual function in different ways, such as pain from arthritis or pelvic problems after childbirth. Diabetes, heart disease, smoking and excess alcohol can also lead to sexual difficulties.

Parkinson's can impact on a person's sex life in various ways:
- **Movement problems** (e.g. slowed movements or difficulties coordinating movements). 
•	**Fatigue** can lower your sex drive (libido). 
•	**Bladder or bowel problems** may make you or your partner nervous about engaging in sexual activity. 
•	**Medication:** some medications (e.g. those used to treat depression) can impact sexual desire, arousal levels, and ability to orgasm. 
•	**Reduced sex drive (libido)** can occur as a result of the psychological and emotional impact of managing a long-term condition or as a direct result of Parkinson’s. Tiredness and depression, which are common in Parkinson’s, can also reduce sex drive. 
•	**Reduced arousal and orgasm:** Parkinson’s can affect the body’s sexual function. 
•	**Confidence.**

Some Parkinson’s medicines (e.g. dopamine agonists) can cause ‘hypersexuality’. This is a marked increase in sexual interest, arousal, and behaviour. It might mean having more sexual thoughts or desire for different sexual practices. See the <a href="/learn/managing-symptoms/impulsive-behaviours" class="internal-link">_Impulsive Behaviours_</a> page for more information.

## What Should I Do About It?
At times, issues with sexual function are normal and may improve on their own. But if they don’t, there are things you can try that might help (see section ‘What can I try for myself?’). 
 
If the problems are more frequent and bother you, talk to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist team. Many people are embarrassed by talking about sex - but remember these conversations are private and confidential. There are possible changes that can be made to medication that may improve your symptoms so do not be afraid to talk about it. 

**Hypersexuality:** If very mild, some couples may feel happy about the increase in sexual activity. But if sexual desires feel out of control, out of character or cause noticeable changes in behaviour then this should be addressed. Speak to your Parkinson’s specialist team urgently if this is the case. For more information, see the _Impulsive Behaviours_ page.

## What Can I Try for Myself?

### Movement Problems
- Some sexual positions might be easier than others.
- Try different times of the day. Ease of movement can change during the day and in response to medication, so you may find some times are better for you than others. 

For more information on movement problems, see our _Involuntary Movement_ page.

### Fatigue
- It may help to try being intimate or having sex at a different time of day or when you have increased energy levels. 

For more information, see our _Tiredness & Fatigue_ page. 

### Bladder & Bowel Problems
- For urinary incontinence: you could try going to the toilet before having sex.
- For bowel incontinence: you could try using an enema before sex, or an anal plug to stop leakage. 

For more advice on bladder and bowel issues, see _Urinary Symptoms_ and _Bowel Symptoms_ pages. 

### Lowered Sex Drive
- If you are feeling low in mood, anxious or tired, see the symptom pages for each of these for more advice.
- Other things you and your partner may wish to try to increase sexual desire:
  - Relax in the bath together
  - Have sensual massages
  - Buy new lingerie or sex toys, watch an arousing video, or read erotic stories to each other.
- It is important to agree beforehand with your partner that the goal is to become closer and enjoy time together – the result may be sex, but it may not. This will take any pressure off and help to create an environment where increased sexual drive can happen more naturally. 

### Problems with Sexual Arousal & Vaginal Dryness
- Consider any emotional factors (e.g. stress or tensions in the relationship) that could be addressed.
- Try a change in routine. For example, having sex in the morning when you have more energy instead of in the evening.
- Using sexual aids, such as a vibrator, to increase stimulation.
- Taking the time to get the mood right and be sensual with each other.
- **Men:** problems with sexual arousal may mean difficulty getting an erection or losing an erection too soon. This is known as Erectile Dysfunction. It is common in men of all ages but increases with age. There are potential treatments that your GP may prescribe, so speak with your GP.
- **Women:** vaginal dryness can be painful. You can buy a range of vaginal lubricants and moisturisers from the chemist. If these don’t help, your GP might prescribe oestrogen replacement cream or could discuss Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). 

### Problems with Orgasm
- Try not to worry.
  - Worrying about orgasming can make it happen too quickly or not at all.
  - Agree with your partner that you’ll enjoy the time being intimate with each other. This means it won’t matter as much if one of you doesn’t reach orgasm.
- Learn what you enjoy.
  - Explore what you find pleasurable, either with a partner or by masturbation.
  - Try to relax into the sensations you have. Feeling ashamed or embarrassed makes it more difficult to achieve orgasm.
- Sex aids (e.g. vibrators and vacuum devices) can help with stimulation and orgasm.
- Pelvic floor exercises.
  - For women, pelvic floor exercises can help to increase awareness of pelvic floor contractions and improve pelvic tone. These can both help with reaching orgasm.
  - If you find pelvic floor exercises challenging a physiotherapist, nurse, or GP can offer advice.

## Further Assessments

### Questions
Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment. 

**They might ask about sexual function:**
- When the problem started
- How much response you have to stimulation.
- Times of the day when problems occur.
- Does the problem occur at a time when the medication feels less effective – “off” times?

## Further Treatments

### Medication
- Changes to Parkinson’s or other medication may improve your symptoms. These changes would most likely be made by your Parkinson’s specialist team.
- **Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional.**
- **Erectile dysfunction:** Possible treatment options include… o Tablets (e.g. Viagra/Cialis/Levitra) o Self-injection or pessary. This is where a drug is injected into the penis or inserted in the end of the penis as a pessary, to produce an erection.
- **Vaginal dryness or pain:** possible treatment options include:
  - Vaginal lubricants
  - Hormonal treatments (for example, Hormone Replacement Therapy)
  - Anaesthetic gels 

### Therapy & Counselling
- **Relationship counselling:** Counsellors can work with couples and individuals (meaning you can go alone if you’re single or if your partner does not wish to join).
  - Ask your GP for services available in your area.
  - Contact your local Relate centre. Visit their website to find your nearest Relate and give them a call. You can find contact details in our _Useful contacts table_ section.
- **Counselling and psychotherapy for sexual problems:** Counselling or psychotherapy may help you to talk openly about any sexual problems you are having. They can also support you to find ways of making helpful changes.
  - Ask your GP for services available in your local area.
- **Psychosexual therapy:** A psychosexual therapist is trained in all aspects of sex and can help you to understand the effects of medication and health conditions on sex.
- You can see a psychosexual therapist on your own or as a couple.
- Ask your GP for services available in your local area. 

### Devices & Surgery
Other treatments for erectile dysfunction:
- **Vacuum pump device:** This is an alternative to medication and is put around the penis to produce an erection.
- **Surgery:** Usually only used as a last resort, a penile prosthesis can be implanted.
