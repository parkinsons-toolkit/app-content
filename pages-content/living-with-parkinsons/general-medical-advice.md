# General Medical Advice

General Medical Advice
As well as managing Parkinson’s, there are general medical recommendations to improve long-
term health. The following advice is based on general NHS guidance, tailored for people with
Parkinson’s. The focus is on things you can do, or support you can access, that may help to prevent
problems in the future.
Vaccinations
Vaccinations are medications designed to prevent infections. Vaccination schedules change over
time according to the latest scientific research. At present (July 2020), the recommendations for
adults with Parkinson’s are:
- Flu: Annual influenza vaccination for all people with Parkinson’s (this is universally
recommended for those aged 65 years and over). The annual influenza vaccination should be
considered for household members and those who care for people with Parkinson’s.
- Pneumonia: One-off vaccination* for all people with Parkinson’s (this is universally
recommended for those aged 65 years and over). There is no vaccine that works against all
the bugs that cause pneumonia, but this targets the most common cause.
* People who don’t have a working spleen or have chronic kidney disease may require boosters
every 5 years.
- Shingles: One-off vaccination when you are 70 years old.
These are all delivered as injections, usually into the arm. You should have vaccines if you are
allergic to the ingredients or are ill at the time. More information can be found on the NHS
website, under ‘Vaccinations’.
Blood pressure
What is blood pressure?
Your heart pushes blood around the body through a
network of blood vessels, similar to the way a pump
pushes fluid through pipes. Your blood pressure is
recorded as two numbers:
- The first or top number is known as systolic blood
pressure. This is the pressure as the heart is pushing, i.e.
the force of that push.
- The second or bottom number is known as diastolic blood
pressure. This is the pressure as the heart relaxes between pushes and the blood is flowing, i.e. the
resistance in the pipes themselves.
Many factors affect blood pressure. It varies between people and is constantly
changing in any one person. This makes it difficult to define “normal” blood pressure. Parkinson’s,
as well as medication used for Parkinson’s, can both cause a lower or variable blood pressure. But
getting older and many lifestyle factors can cause a higher blood pressure.
High blood pressure
- Blood pressure increases with age and certain lifestyle factors. These include smoking, alcohol,
caffeine, unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and increased weight. It is also elevated by stress and pain.
- Generally, a blood pressure above 140/90mmHg is high for those under 80 years old and above
150/90mmHg for those over 80 years old.
- High blood pressure usually does not cause any symptoms. But, if left untreated it can cause serious
health conditions, such as heart attacks and strokes.
- A healthy lifestyle will reduce the chance of getting high blood pressure and can lower your blood
pressure if it’s high. Many people will need medication to treat high blood pressure. See the NHS
website (www.nhs.uk) for more information.
Low blood pressure
- Blood pressure may be low because of: a long-term health condition (e.g. Parkinson’s); medication
(including many used to treat Parkinson’s); or an illness (e.g. an infection).
- Generally, a blood pressure below 90/60mmHg is considered low. But, a problematic low blood
pressure is when it causes symptoms.
- Symptoms of low blood pressure include:
- Feeling lightheaded, faint or dizzy – this may
cause you to faint
- Feeling sick o Blurred vision o Feeling generally
weak
- Feeling muddled
Low blood pressure does not always require treatment, but may do if you are experiencing
symptoms. See the Dizziness page for more information. Treatment of any other cause, like
infection, is also important.
Parkinson’s and blood pressure
Parkinson’s is often linked to low blood pressure or varying blood pressure. Many people
experience a drop in blood pressure when they change to a more upright position (i.e. going from
sitting to standing). This is known as postural or orthostatic hypotension. For more information
on this, see our Dizziness page.
When should I get my blood pressure checked?
It is recommended that everyone over the age of 40 years has their blood pressure tested at least
every 5 years. It should be checked more frequently if you are at risk of blood pressure problems.
Since Parkinson’s and the medication used to treat it both impact on blood
pressure, you should have it checked more often. There is no official rule for how frequently you
should have your blood pressure checked. This decision will vary according to each person’s
circumstance and will be guided by a healthcare professional. It will normally be at least once a
year.
How can I get my blood pressure checked?
You can have your blood pressure tested at your GP surgery, hospital appointments, and some
pharmacies. Or, you can buy your own blood pressure monitor for use at home. The British and
Irish Hypertension Society and Blood Pressure UK both have advice on validated monitors. See
our More Information section for links to their websites.
Bone health
- Broken bones, or fractures, are more likely to happen if you have fragile bones and if you fall
over.
- It is recommended that everyone with Parkinson’s take vitamin D supplements to help
maintain bone strength.
- You can buy these from the chemist. If you do not
need to take calcium tablets as well, you can buy
these as Vitamin D3. We would normally
recommend taking a daily dose of 20 or
25micrograms (μg) which is equivalent to 800 or
1000units a day (unless your doctor has
recommended a different dose). If you are not
sure on what dose to take, or if you should take calcium as well, discuss this with your
GP.
- If you are particularly at risk, your GP may do a blood test to check your vitamin D
level. If they are low, you may need a higher dose of vitamin D to bring your levels
back up to normal.
- As people get older, in particular women, their bones can become less dense and more brittle.
If this is higher than expected for your age, you may be diagnosed with Osteoporosis. If your
bones
are thinner, this makes them more likely to fracture from low impact injuries (e.g. breaking your
wrist after falling).
- If you have sustained a broken bone from a low impact injury, your GP should assess your
bone health. o They will take into account your height, weight and risk factors (e.g. smoking).
- Depending on the outcome of this assessment, they may want to do blood tests and/or a bone
scan (called a DXA scan).
- There are medications that can help to strengthen bones if they are found to be low density. They
may also prescribe combined calcium and vitamin D3 tablets.
Lifestyle choices
Smoking
- Smoking has negative impacts on many aspects of health. It can contribute to symptoms such as
fatigue, loss of taste and smell, sexual problems, and low mood and anxiety.
- Research has shown there are lower rates of smoking in people with Parkinson’s compared with
people without Parkinson’s. Why this is the case is not fully understood. But, research so far concludes
that risks of smoking outweigh the benefits. There is no evidence that smoking will stop or slow
Parkinson’s.
- There are services available to help you stop smoking. See the NHS website (www.nhs.uk) for more
details.
Alcohol
- This is covered in more detail on our Eating Well page.
- Guidelines recommend you drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week (2 units = a pint of beer or
a medium glass of wine)
- If you think you drink too much alcohol, there is lots of support available. See the NHS website
(www.nhs.uk) for more information.
Cannabis
- Cannabis is a class-B controlled drug in the UK. Possessing, producing, or supplying cannabis is illegal.
- Cannabis use can have serious risks for your physical and mental health so is not recommended.
- There has been research interest in medical uses of cannabis-based products. Some of these products
are available on prescription or can be bought legally as a supplement.
- At present, there is no evidence to support the use of cannabis-based products for Parkinson’s.
See our Eating Well page for more information on supplements.
Vision & hearing
Addressing sight or hearing deterioration may mean having treatment or aids to improve those
senses. Vision and hearing are important for interacting with others and carrying out daily
activities.
Vision
- It is recommended that everyone has regular sight tests. This is normally every two years but
may be more in certain circumstances.
- At present, the NHS provides free sight tests to people:
- Aged over 60 years o Under 60 years with diabetes or glaucoma o With specific
risks of glaucoma.
- Receiving certain financial benefits.
- If you are entitled to a free NHS sight test but can’t leave home, you may qualify
for a “mobile sight test” where an optician comes to your house. Speak to your optician if you
need this service.
- Most sight problems are not preventable. But, there are ways you can help to protect your
vision:
- Protect your eyes from injury or chemicals (e.g. wear goggles when doing DIY or
gardening) o Protect your eyes from the sun (i.e.
wear sunglasses)
- When using computer or phone screens, try to
blink regularly and give your eyes breaks. You
could do this by looking out of the window for a
few minutes. People with Parkinson’s often blink
less without realising so may need to make more
of a conscious effort to blink.
Hearing
- You will need a hearing test if you, or someone close to you, notices that your hearing has got
worse.
- At present, hearing tests are provided on the NHS if you notice a problem with your hearing.
You can access it by seeing your GP who can refer you to a hearing specialist, though this can
take some time.
- Some large pharmacies or opticians offer hearing tests. This might be free or you may need to
pay. You will need to speak with the pharmacy or opticians for more information on this.
- There are some simple hearing tests online if you are not sure if you have hearing difficulties.
These tests can advise whether you need a full formal test or not.
- Hearing problems are often not preventable. You can help to protect your hearing by
minimising loud noise exposure. Be mindful of how loud your music plays, time spent at noisy
events, and potential noise exposure at work.
More information about healthcare costs is on our Finances page. For more information about sight
and hearing problems, see our 5 Senses page.
Foot care
Foot problems can be painful and can affect your walking and balance. Taking care of your feet will
help prevent problems in the future.
- Wash your feet daily, but don’t soak them.
- Dry your feet thoroughly after washing. Too much moisture increases the risk of fungal infection.
- If you have dry skin, moisturise them but avoid the area between the toes as this is prone to moisture.
- Changes socks daily. Cotton, wool, or bamboo socks are more ‘breathable’.
- Cut toenails carefully: cut straight across rather than down at the edges to
avoid ingrown toenails.
- Feet can change size over the course of the day due to swelling. This is usually largest later in the day.
Keep this in mind when buying your shoes to make sure they are a suitable fit.
- Wear sensible footwear, not spending too much time in high heels. See the College of Podiatry
website (listed below) for more information on choosing shoes.
- Don’t let your socks bunch up and rub on your feet. Avoid seams or elastic cutting into your skin;
elastic-free socks are available.
- Apply caution in communal areas: shared showers (e.g. at the gym) and swimming pool areas are
associated with foot infections.
- If you notice a problem with your feet, such as an infection, get it treated promptly so it does not
develop complications. Some treatments are available from the pharmacy, or you can see your GP or
practice nurse. In some cases you will be referred to a foot specialist, known as a podiatrist.
Dental care
Taking care of your teeth is really important as poor dental health can lead to pain and infections. It
may even lead to difficulties eating and drinking in the long run.
- Brush your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and floss daily.
- Reduce sugar intake
- Have regular check-ups with your dentist. Dental checks are provided by the NHS for a fee, unless
you are on a low income. See the NHS website (www.nhs.uk) for more information on who qualifies
for free NHS dental care. The frequency of check-up depends on the health of your teeth and gums.
Your dentist can advise on this.
- Don’t delay treatments if you have a problem. Many dental treatments are available on the NHS, but
most will require a contribution to the cost which can vary in amount depending on the treatment
needed. People in receipt of certain financial benefits are entitled to free NHS dental treatment.
Bowel care
Avoiding constipation is very important in Parkinson’s. For more
information, see the Bowel Symptoms page.
Key ways to avoid constipation:
- Eat plenty of fibre
- Drink plenty of water
- Be active
- Keep your skin clean, but avoid harsh soaps as
Skin c are
they can wash away the natural skin oils.
- If you have dry skin, avoid harsh alcohol-based washes as they
can be irritating and drying.
- If you have dry skin, moisturise to avoid the skin cracking. Your
pharmacist can advise on which creams would be better for this.
- If you have oily skin, use water-based products instead of oil-
based products.
- Avoid prolonged pressure through a single area of skin (e.g.
sitting in the same position for a long time) as this can damage the skin.
- Some sun exposure is good and helps your body maintain vitamin D levels. However excessive
sun exposure increases the risk of skin damage and skin cancer. See the NHS website
(www.nhs.uk) for some tips on safe sun exposure.
See our Skin Changes page for more information on this.

Practical Advice
The information on the practical advice pages was correct at the time of publishing. Live Well with
Parkinson’s does not take responsibility for the accuracy of information within these pages or that
found by visiting a link on this site. The content is for your information and should not be used as
legal advice.
Parkinson’s can affect day-to-day activities. But, there is lots of support available and there are
many strategies you can try yourself. This section is about being aware of your options and
‘problem solving’ rather than medical aspects.
Remember, asking for help is not a weakness. Part of managing your condition involves knowing
when and how to find help. Asking for help can be difficult, but most people want to be helpful
but may not know how.
Finding resources
This can be quite a detective job. Sometimes it can be quick to find the right information, but
other times it can take a while to find what you’re looking for. We hope to provide specific pointers
for more common issues in the pages that follow, but not everything can be anticipated. If you
need help that is not covered here, try asking yourself the following questions:
1. What is the issue?
2. What it is that you need or want that might address it?
3. Who/where might have leads to find this solution?
