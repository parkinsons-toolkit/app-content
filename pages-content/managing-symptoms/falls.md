# Balance & Falls Introduction  

Falls can be a significant source of concern and stress for some people with Parkinson’s. There are many things that can be done to help prevent them from happening. Falling over is more common in Parkinson’s for a number of reasons, but they can also be reasons not related to Parkinson’s.

## What might be causing it?  
Whether you have Parkinson’s or not, the risk of falls goes up with age. Factors that can make it more likely are:  

- Problems with joints, such as arthritis  
- Problems with muscles. This could be from general weakness to a specific muscle disorder.  
- Having had previous falls  
- Having dementia  
- Having depression  
- Taking medications that cause drowsiness  
- Other health issues, such as infections.  
- Problems with your vision  

**Symptoms of Parkinson’s that can contribute to falls include:**  

- Movements being stiffer, slower or smaller. For example, taking smaller steps can cause a person to trip. ‘Freezing’ when walking can also be a problem, especially when turning.  
- A bent posture can affect balance.  
- Involuntary movements (‘dyskinesia’) can change your centre of gravity and affect balance.  
- Feeling dizzy, faint, or like your legs are giving way, due to drops in blood pressure.  
- Reduced control of balance.  
- Sleepiness, low mood or difficulty concentrating  
- Problems with sight, such as seeing double.  
- Bladder and bowel symptoms that can lead you to rush to get to the toilet.  

There is more information on these on their respective symptom pages.  

Some medicines make the above symptoms worse and this can increase your chance of falling over. These symptoms, as well as pain or other health conditions, can lead to lower levels of activity. Less activity can lead to weaker muscles and worse balance.  

Other health conditions can increase your risk of falls, such as arthritis or old injuries. Falls can also come about because of a new illness, such as a urine infection.  

**External factors also contribute to balance and falls:**  

- Footwear  
- Lighting  
- The surface – e.g. uneven pavement, narrow steps, loose rugs  
- Obstacles – e.g. trailing cables, pets

## What should I do about it?  

There are lots of things you can try yourself to improve your balance and reduce your risk of falling over.  

These symptoms can call for a professional assessment. This is both for the cause(s) and the consequences. It might also include an assessment of your home to look at the environment and safety measures.  

If you develop new symptoms of imbalance or falls, or have had a rapid change in the pattern of your falls you should see your GP as soon as possible.  

If your falls are associated with worsening movement symptoms, like stiffness or slowness of movement, or you have had a recent change in your Parkinson’s medication, you should consult your Parkinson’s team.

### You should seek help urgently, via your GP or A&E, if:  

1. You have had a potentially serious injury, e.g. if you are unable to get off the floor.  
2. You take blood thinning medication and have had a head injury.  
3. The fall was associated with other significant symptoms, for example:  
   - Loss of consciousness (blacking out)  
   - Palpitations (feeling your heart racing)  
   - Feeling breathless  
   - Chest pain  
   - Feeling sweaty or clammy  
4. You have a new symptom after the fall:  
   - Drowsiness  
   - Weakness on one side of the body  
   - Significant pain

## What can I try for myself?  

There are many things you can do for yourself to improve balance, prevent falls and manage the risk surrounding them.  

### Keep Active  
It is important to try to stay as active as possible, unless you have been specifically advised otherwise. Staying active helps you maintain muscle strength and balance so reduces your chance of falling over. It is also good for your Parkinson’s and general health.  

- Making big movements  
- Carrying out more than one task at a time, known as ‘dual-tasking’.  

Exercises to achieve these need to be tailored to your ability and needs.  

For more on all of these aspects, see the Keeping Active page.

## Tips to prevent falls  

- Give yourself time.  
- Reduce unnecessary distractions.  
- Where possible, it will also help to address other factors that can contribute such as pain, tiredness and stress.  
- Many falls are associated with drops in blood pressure. There are tips for dealing with this on the Dizziness page.  
- Ensure you have appropriate footwear. Low heels or flat soles are better, and solid shoes with good support are better. Try to avoid unsupportive shoes, such as flip-flops, floppy slippers, or high heels.  
- Get a sight test – see General Medical Advice page for more information.  

---

## Environment  

- Ensure adequate lighting.  
- Try to minimise obstacles, like clutter on the floor or trailing cables.  
- Place furniture in strategic locations in case you need to use it as support as you move around.  
- Consider the surface you are walking on – watch out for wet floors or loose rugs.  
- Be careful what you lean on – don’t lean on something that might move or come off a wall.  
- Consider changing patterned surfaces that make it harder to judge distances, for example patterned carpets.  
- Consider applying a strip of coloured tape to the edge of steps/stairs to highlight them and make it easier to judge the step.  
- Make the items you use regularly accessible.  
- Consider the use of a Reacher to pick things up.  

---

## Safety  

- Recognise your limits.  
- Have a back-up plan – how could you get help if you ran into trouble?  
  - For example, you could keep your mobile phone in your pocket.  
  - Personal alarms and security systems (telecare) are devices that call for help if you have a problem at home.  

---

## Alarms and Security  

- There are a wide range of systems available.  
- You can buy these yourself, either online or from high street shops. Some basic systems may be available through Adult Social Care services.  
- **Basic alarms:** can be worn (e.g. on your wrist or as a pendant) or placed in the home. When you press the alarm they can either make a loud noise to send a signal to someone.  
- **Key safes:** these are boxes installed outside your home that hold the key to your home. They can be opened using a code. They are used to allow people into your home in an emergency.  
- **Security systems, for example:**  
  - Devices to track your location so someone could find you if needed.  
  - Sensors that detect if you fall over.  

More information about these systems is available on the NHS website and the Which? Later Life Care website.

## My Experience  

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.  

> “I store things I use daily, like medication or towels, between waist and eye-level, so I can avoid reaching or bending, which can throw me off balance”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*  

> “We’ve got buzzers. We’ve got pendants really. It connects to a mainline where they talk to you through the phone. They just say, ‘what’s wrong’? They know your name and everything and then they’ll send a medic or whatever’s needed. It is good. We pay for it, but it’s worth it. It’s not much.”  
> *(Person with Parkinson’s)*  

---

## Further assessment  

What we need to get to the bottom of is:  

1. What is causing the falls?  
2. What is the consequence of the falls?  
3. What might be done to reduce the frequency of and impact of falls?  

This is often not a quick process, and you may be referred on to another service for a further assessment.  

### Questions  

- Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your “My Health” section to bring to the appointment.  
- See extra information below about things they might ask about.  

**They may ask about:**  

- Description of before, during and after the fall(s). Did you lose consciousness (‘black out’)? How did you feel just before the fall? How did you feel after the fall?  
- Did someone else see the fall? If so, how did you look before, during or after the fall?  
- Any injuries from the fall(s)?  
- Any triggers for falls?  
- Any other symptoms you have been experiencing?  
- About your home environment  
- About the risk factors for falls as discussed above.  
- If possible, it can be helpful for them to speak to someone else who saw the fall.

## Track your symptoms in the Symptom and Activity Tracker  

- This can help you to recall the details and help your health professional look for patterns.  
- For balance problems and falls the nature of the diary will depend on what you are experiencing.  

**If it does not happen often:**  
It would be best to note just when it occurs rather than tracking symptoms all the time. It is helpful to note what actually happened (e.g. “I was getting up from bed to go to the toilet in the night. It was dark and I tripped over the rug in my bedroom”), any other symptoms you experienced (e.g. dizziness), and anything you notice about the circumstances (e.g. “I had not slept well last night”).  

**If falls are occurring very often (daily or multiple times a day):**  
Then a 3-5 day period of monitoring may be helpful. This could include symptoms as well as when you take your medication and what your food and drink intake has been. It is helpful to record what you were doing at the time of each fall (e.g. “I got up from my chair to answer the door”).  

---

## Tests  

Once a health professional has done an assessment, they may need further tests. This could be to determine the cause of the fall or to evaluate an injury.  

---

## Further treatments  

Once you have spoken to a healthcare professional, they can help reassure you. They can also look into further treatment.  

### Treatment for an underlying cause  

- This will vary according to the cause, for example:  
  - If they think it is due to low blood pressure, then they may adjust your medication to treat the low blood pressure.  
  - If they think you have an infection, they may give you antibiotics.  

---

## Falls services  

- You may be referred to a falls service.  
- A falls service will be run by professionals with different skills working as a team.  
- The teams are designed to:  
  - Assess for a range of factors that can lead to falls, such as balance problems, and medication.  
  - Assess specific risks, such as risks of breaking bones.  
  - Assess your home environment for hazards.  
  - Give falls prevention strategies, which will address issues identified and provide strength and balance training. These may be offered as a group class.  
  - The assessment and recommendations will be tailored to you. They aim to promote independence and wellbeing.  
- They can also recommend equipment or alarm systems if this is needed.  

---

## Physiotherapy & Occupational Therapy  

- You may be referred to a physiotherapist or occupational therapist. This will likely be if you are not being seen in a falls service. In some areas there are specialist teams for people with conditions like Parkinson’s.  
- See the Who May be Involved page for more information about the different professional roles.  
- They assess your walking and how you transfer between positions (like getting up from a chair).  
- They will aim to give you tailored strategies and exercises, to help your balance and reduce the risk of falls.  
- They will also consider your home environment.  
- If appropriate, they will advise about:  
  - Walking aids, e.g. walking sticks  
  - Equipment or adaptations, e.g. rails  
  - Extra support, e.g. carers  
  - Alarm systems  

They may make recommendations to the Adult Social Care services if this is needed.  

Please see the Practical Advice pages for guidance on daily activities.  

---

## Adult Social Care Services  

- They can assess for extra support, requirements for your home and alarm systems if needed.  

---

## Medication  

- Doctors (e.g. GP or neurologist) and some senior nurses (e.g. Parkinson’s Specialist Nurses) may change your medication if they have the expertise.  
- Please do not make any changes to your medication regime without speaking with a healthcare professional  
- If you are found to have fragile bones (osteoporosis) so at higher risk of breaking bones you may be given medication to treat this  
- A decision made about medication is based on weighing up the risks and the gains for the individual.  

**Medications linked with a higher risk of falls include:**  

- Parkinson’s medication  
- Sedating medication – e.g. diazepam, zopiclone  
- Some pain medication – e.g. morphine, oxycodone, gabapentin, amitriptyline  
- Medication used for the bladder - Anticholinergic medications – e.g. oxybutynin, solifenacin  
- Medication for the prostate – alpha blockers e.g. tamsulosin  
- Medication used for mood symptoms – e.g. nortriptyline, mirtazapine, venlafaxine (and less so: SSRIs e.g. citalopram, sertraline, paroxetine, fluoxetine)  
- Medication used for psychiatric illness – e.g. chlorpromazine, quetiapine  
- Medication used for seizures – e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine (less so valproate)  
- Muscle relaxants – e.g. baclofen  
- Antihistamines – e.g. chlorphenamine  
- Medication used for dizziness – e.g. prochlorperazine, cinnarazine, betahistine  
- Medication used for heart or blood pressure:  
  - alpha blockers (e.g. doxazosin)  
  - diuretic medications (e.g. bendroflumethiazide, furosemide, bumetanide, indapamide)  
  - ACE-inhibitors (e.g. Ramipril, Lisinopril, perindopril, enalapril)  
  - ARBs (e.g. losartan, candesartan)  
  - beta blockers (atenolol, propranolol, bisoprolol)  
  - anti-anginals (e.g. GTN, ISMN, nicorandil)  
  - calcium channel blockers (e.g. amlodipine, nifedipine, diltiazem, verapamil)  
  - arrhythmia medicines (e.g. digoxin, amiodarone)  
- Medication used in dementia (e.g. donepezil, rivastigmine).

## Alexander Technique  

- The Alexander Technique is a technique to improve posture and movement that can be taught. It focuses on balance and posture.  
- It can be considered for people with Parkinson’s who have issues with movements or balance.  
- In some areas this is an NHS service but in some areas it is only available privately.  

---

## Other specialist services  

For specific causes of falls you may be referred to a specialist service. For example if your doctor thinks your falls may be a heart problem, you may be referred to a cardiologist.  

---

## Key messages  

- Issues with balance and falls are seen in Parkinson’s. They may have other causes, so this does warrant a full assessment the first time or if there is a change.  
- Assessment may be through your GP, physiotherapist, a local falls service or a specialist.  
- Physiotherapists have expertise in helping with walking and balance. They can give advice on ways to reduce the risk of falls.
