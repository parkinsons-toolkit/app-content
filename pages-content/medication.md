# Medication

brain. Most of the medicines for Parkinson’s work in different ways to improve
dopamine messaging.
It can take some time to find the best medicine regime for you. Symptoms change,
so your regime may need to change as well. Your Parkinson’s specialist team will
work with you to adjust medication and optimise symptom control.
It is important not to change your medication without discussing this with your GP
or Parkinson’s team first. Any withdrawal from Parkinson’s drugs must be done
gradually.
Commonly Used Medications
The Symptom Management pages have guidance for dealing with the side effects
that are listed below. If you experience side effects, consult these pages and speak
to your Parkinson’s specialist team. There are also other possible side effects that
can occur. Some medications cannot be used together with other medications.
Your prescribing doctor will take this into account when prescribing medication.

1. Levodopa Medications
   What does it do?

- Levodopa is converted to dopamine in the body
- Levodopa is combined with another medicine into one pill. This other
  medicine only prevents the levodopa from being broken down before it
  gets to the brain.
- This other medicine does not help Parkinson’s symptoms.
- The two medicines are combined into one pill.
- See chart below for common levodopa medications.

  What are the side effects?
  Not all patients will experience side effects while taking levodopa.
  The more common are:
- Nausea (feeling sick) or vomiting – this usually goes away after a couple of weeks. It
  may be eased by taking the medicine with a small amount of food. Some people use
  an anti-sickness medicine (e.g. Domperidone) short-term when first starting
  levodopa.
- Low blood pressure - which can cause symptoms of dizziness or feeling generally weak
  or faint.
- Sleepiness.
- Levodopa may cause urine to turn reddish-brown. This is harmless.
- With long term use, some people may also experience involuntary movements
  (dyskinesia) or hallucinations.
  Food can affect how levodopa gets absorbed into your body. For some people this
  impact of food is noticeable. See the Eating Well page for more guidance.

3. Other medications may be used to treat specific symptoms. See Symptom
   Management
   pages for more details.
   Side effects of Parkinson’s medications
   Although rare, Parkinson’s medication carries a risk of causing unusual behaviour.
   They are called ‘Impulse Control Disorders’, which you can read about in this
   resource pack. This means behaviours that are difficult to control. Examples
   include gambling, shopping, binge-eating, hyper-sexuality. They are more
   common in people on dopamine agonists. You and those close to you should
   watch out for these. If this happens, it is vital to tell your GP or Parkinson’s
   specialist team. A change in your medication may be necessary.
   Who should I talk to about my medication?
   Who you should talk to depends on the subject of the query. Although there is some
   variation in practice, in general:

- Do not change/stop medication without discussion first.
- Contact your GP for: o Repeat prescriptions o If you have a
  planned medication change with your specialist team, but
  don’t have it on your prescription yet. The plan should have
  been recorded in your clinic letter. Note some GPs may want
  this to be done in an appointment.
- For medication for another health condition (unless you see a specialist team for this
  condition, then try contacting that team)
- Contact your specialist team for: o If you are unsure about a
  change to your Parkinson’s medication o If a change to your
  Parkinson’s medication has not gone well
- Speak to a pharmacist about: o General medication advice o If
  you are worried about the impact of one medication on
  another
  Getting Medication
- Long term medication should be issued on a repeat prescription by your GP.
- You will need to request and collect the repeat prescription. If not, you may
  run out of the medicine. You can set a reminder to reorder your medicine
  using the To-Do-List & Notes section.
- Consider asking your GP surgery if they can send prescriptions directly to the
  pharmacy.
- Some pharmacies offer home delivery services for people who find it difficult
  to get out of the house. Ask your pharmacist if this is an issue.

  Prescription charges
- At present, in England, prescriptions are charged per item unless you are
  exempt. You are exempt if you are over 60 years old. Certain medical or
  financial circumstances also make people exempt.
  See the NHS website for more details.
- Having Parkinson’s is not (at present) listed as a reason for exemption from NHS
  prescription charges.
- A prescription prepayment certificate (PPC) could save you money on NHS
  prescription costs. See the Finances page for more details.
  Taking Medication
  Packaging
  Getting medications out of their packets can be tricky. Pill
  ejectors may help:
- Pill ejectors push a pill out of its packaging.
- They are small plastic devices that applies more pressure to the
  packaging than you can with your bare hands.
- Try not to break your pills when using it.
- Check that there are no stickers or labels on the back of the blister
  packs. They will make it more difficult to push the pills through.
  Cutting Medicine
  Sometimes people are required to take only half or a quarter of a pill. Some find it
  easier to take smaller size pills.
  Note, not all medicines are suitable to be cut:
- Controlled release or modified release tablets should not be cut or broken.
  Cutting interferes with the controlled release mechanism. Examples: Sinemet
  CR, Ropinirole XL, Pramipexole PR.
- Madopar capsules should not be split. Splitting affects the dose you receive. It
  would be better to have dispersible Madopar tablets.
- Entacapone or Stalevo can be split to ease swallowing. However, the cut edges
  taste unpleasant.
  How to cut tablets? Using a pill cutter is more precise than trying to snap pills.
- Usually a lid with a razor-sharp blade, combined with a small plastic container.
- You put the pill inside, bring the lid down, and the pill is cut cleanly in half.
- Use caution when using the cutter to avoid injuries from the blade.
  Dispersible tablets, such as ‘Madopar dispersible’, can be dissolved in water.
- To take half a dose: it can be easier to dissolve the whole tablet and only drink
  half of the mixture, than to cut the tablet in half.
  Using Medication Patches
  Medication patches can be a good alternative to tablets for people who have swallowing
  difficulties.
  Instructions should be provided, but in general:
- Apply the patch to clean, dry, healthy skin. Not to irritated or broken skin.
- Apply on the torso, thigh, hip, shoulder or upper arm
- When applying, press the patch firmly against the skin for about 30 seconds.
- Also remember to remove the patch as instructed (usually when applying the
  new one).
- Avoid re-using the same area of skin when replacing the patch. Try to avoid re-
  using the same area of skin for 14 days.
  Check your specific instructions, but in general the patches are designed such that
  they are ok to get wet. However, you should avoid exposing the patch to high
  temperatures (e.g. hot sunny days or electric blankets). Heat can cause more
  medicine to pass from the patch into the body than is intended and cause side
  effects. If a patch falls off, you will need to apply a fresh one on until the time you
  usually change it. Some people find bandaging tape helpful if the edges of the
  patch lift off.
  Note Rotigotine patches contain metal and should be removed before having an MRI scan.
  Swallowing Medicine
  Some people have difficulty with swallowing their medication. If this is the case:
  speak to your GP or Parkinson’s specialist. You may require further assessment or
  a change to your medicines. For example, this could be using a dissolvable tablet
  or a patch. See swallowing difficulties page for more information.
  Missed Medicines
  What to do if you miss a medication depends on:
- How frequently you take the medication
  •
  •
- When you realise it was missed.
  These are general principles relevant to Parkinson’s medication.
- If you are unsure then speak to a healthcare professional.
- If you have difficulty remembering medication read the “Organising
  Medication” section below.
  The question to ask yourself is: Am I due another dose very
  soon?
  Yes  Skip a dose.
  For example
  Mr X normally takes levodopa every 4 hours: at 8am, 12pm, 4pm,
  and 8pm.
  Mr X missed the 8am dose and realised at 11:30am.
  Mr X could take the dose at 11:30am and skip the 12pm dose.
  No  Take the missed dose as soon as you remember.
  Adjust the rest of your doses for the day to be similar spacing to your
  normal regime. You may need to bring them slightly closer together (e.g.
  30 minutes closer).
  For example
  Mr X normally takes levodopa every 4 hours: at 8am, 12pm, 4pm,
  and 8pm.
  Mr X missed the 8am dose and realised at 10:30am.
  Mr X could take the dose at 10:30am and adjust the later doses to
  be every 3.5-4 hours: 2pm, 5:30pm, and 9:30pm.
  The next day, return back to the normal schedule.
  If you miss a tablet later in the day, you may not be able to easily fit all the doses
  in before bed. Rather than taking them very close together, you may need to miss
  one out for that day. This can be a tricky judgement to make.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“I find the tablets hard to swallow. I got used to having ice cream with them
now that works nicely. I learnt that by trial and error.” (Person with
Parkinson’s)
Organising Medication

- Some people with Parkinson’s have complicated medication schedules. They can be
  difficult to remember.
- It is important to be organised and safe with medication. Try to keep them together in
  a safe and secure place, out of reach of children.
- Medication management aids can help you to stay on top of your medication schedule.
- Note, some medicines should not be stored outside of their original packaging. Check
  with the pharmacist before changing their storage.
  Pill o rganisers
- These have many different names, including:
- Dossette boxes
- Blister packs o

Medication
Compliance Aid
(MCA) o Multi-
dose System
(MDS)

- Used to arrange and store medication in compartments, sorted by day and time.
- They may be filled by a pharmacist, or they can be self-filled.
- Can range from 7-28 compartments. If you take your medicine 4 times per day, a 28-
  compartment device can cover a full week.
- If you need more compartments, you can use two.
- There are different types:
- Different shapes, e.g. square or round. o Single use, with
  compartments sealed with foil. o Re-useable, with
  compartments with lids then open and close. o Some
  have alert functions.
- Automatic pill dispensers: They are set to ‘unlock’ one
  compartment at a time. This makes sure you are aware
  •
  •
  when a dose is due. It makes it easier to take the right
  amount of medication.
  Travel-size pill timers
- Portable devices that hold a small number of medication doses (usually enough
  for one day).
- They may have a small alarm to remind you when to take your medication.
- They can be useful to ensure you have the medicines you need when you are
  out and about.
  Medication alerts
- Alert you to take your medication, e.g. with sound, vibration, lights.
- Some pill organisers have alert functions.
- Some advanced devices can send a text message to an emergency contact
  number if you don’t take a dose within a specified timeframe.
- Many people find timers on mobile phones or digital watches useful.
- Some people prefer vibrating alerts instead of sound or light, to draw less
  attention.
  How to get these?
- In some select cases, simple pill organisers are provided through the NHS.
  Speak to your GP or pharmacist to see if you are eligible.
- You can buy them yourself. There are many options online or in supermarkets
  and chemists.
- You must check your medicines are suitable to be stored in them first. Speak to
  your pharmacist about this.
  How to choose?
- If you have difficulty using your hands, you might prefer a design that has larger
  compartments and buttons.
- Simpler pill organisers are better if you have difficulty with your memory or
  thinking.
- Look for alarms that are easy to set and reset automatically for the next dose.
- Many have ‘pre-set’ alarms that repeat daily. This may or may not be suitable
  for you, depending
  on your medication schedule.
  There are also other possible side effects that can occur and some medications
  cannot be used together with other medications. Your prescribing doctor will be
  take this into account when prescribing medication.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.
“The advice I would give to people is that you prepare yourself a schedule
….unless you write it down and give yourself something to work to, you can,
you can go wrong.” (Carer)
“My grandchildren have set it up. It comes on, and the alarm goes,
“Parkinson’s”, so I know to take my tablets.” (person with Parkinson’s)

  Advanced Therapies & Surgical Treatments
  Apomorphine
  injections
  What is it?
  Intermittent injections of a medicine called apomorphine (a dopamine agonist).
  The injections go into the skin, a bit like an epi-pen or insulin pen. The medication works
  quickly, in 5-10 minutes. It lasts for about 40 minutes.
  Who is it for?
  You may be able to have this treatment if:

* You are diagnosed with Parkinson’s and have specific difficulties, such as:
* Significant periods where the medication has become less effective, ‘off’ periods.
* Your symptoms respond well to medication.
  Symptoms that don’t get better with other Parkinson’s medications don’t
  tend to improve with apomorphine injections either. These may include
  problems with speaking, swallowing, falling due to loss of postural reflexes,
