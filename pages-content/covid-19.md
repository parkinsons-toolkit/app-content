  There are a number of factors that make people more vulnerable to COVID-

    these symptoms. Although they do not have a weakened immune system,
    they are more likely to develop chest infections. Infections can cause

    higher risk of developing complications.

- Older age – people aged 65 years and older are at the greatest risk of
  severe illness compared to younger people.
- Living in long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, puts people
  at an increased risk of severe illness.
- Male sex- is a risk factor for infection and severe disease.
- Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) groups- are at a higher risk of
  infection and more likely to have worse outcomes compared to the general
  population.
- Comorbidities- people with more than one medical condition are at a
  higher risk of severe illness. The most common conditions are: high blood
  pressure, cardiovascular disease (including heart problems and stroke),
  diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, cancer, chronic kidney disease, and

  What to do if you have symptoms?
  If you think you have COVID-19 it is important to self-isolate to prevent it
  spreading and to get tested.
  Isolating
  After: 0.15 pt
  If you have symptoms, you should self-isolate for 10
  Right: 0.08 cm, Space After: 0.15 pt
  days. Your isolation period includes the day your
  symptoms started and the next 10 full days. If you
  still have a high temperature after 10 days or are
  otherwise unwell, stay at home and seek medical
  advice. The cough and changes in sense of smell or
  taste can last for several weeks. If these are your only symptoms after the
  10 days then you are allowed to stop isolating.

  of symptoms starting. On days 1 to 7 you can get tested at a site or at home.
  On day 8, you need to go to a test site as it’s too late to order a home test
  kit.
