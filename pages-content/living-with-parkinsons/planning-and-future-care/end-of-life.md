# Preparing for the End of Life

Regardless of health conditions, for many people, the thought of dying is wrapped up in fear and uncertainty. Attitudes are influenced by culture, religion, family, and life experiences.  
If you are ready to think about your future, there are things you can consider now. These can be a positive and empowering way to prepare.

## Preparation

### Loved Ones
- Are there people you want to see or conversations you want to have before you die?  
  This may involve reconnecting, settling a disagreement, or telling someone you love them.
- How do you want to be remembered?  
  Some people write letters or put together memory boxes for loved ones.

## Communicating Your Wishes
Towards the end of life, it may become more difficult to communicate your wishes. Planning in advance helps ensure they are respected — both for your care and for after death.

- **Advanced Statement / Advanced Care Plan**  
  A record of your wishes. If you cannot express them later, this must be considered.
- **Advance Decision (Living Will)**  
  A legal record of wishes to refuse specific medical treatments under specific circumstances.  
  - Legally binding when valid and applicable.  
  - Ensure people know where it is kept.
- **Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)**  
  Legally nominate someone to make decisions for you. This process includes notifying essential people.  
  - Inform loved ones and care providers who you have nominated.
- **Will**  
  A legal document that sets out how you wish your property, money, and possessions to be distributed after death.  
  - Without one, standard legal rules apply.  
  - Ensure loved ones know where it is kept.
- **Wishes for your body after death** (can be included in an Advanced Statement)  
  - Register to donate to research  
  - Register for organ donation  
  - Burial or cremation preferences  
  - Funeral plans

## Practical Preparation

Consider legal and financial matters. Are there loose ends to tie up or details to share?  
If you provide financial or caregiving support to others, plan for their future.

**Legal and financial details to securely record:**
- Your records of wishes (as above)
- Bank account details, debit and credit cards
- Loans, mortgages, standing orders, direct debits
- Accountant, tax or financial adviser, solicitor contacts
- State benefits and pensions
- Tax references
- Inheritance tax details (e.g., large gifts in the past 7 years)
- Property ownership or rental details, key holders, utility providers
- Insurance policies

**Other practical considerations:**
- Pets and their welfare
- Online or social media accounts
- Significant possessions (computers, phones, cars)
- Health contacts
- Carer or care agency details
- Employer details

## Place of Care

When close to dying, it can be difficult to move. Understanding preferences can help plan ahead.  
Consider available **Palliative Care** services.

### 1. Own Home or Home of a Loved One
- Services can support end-of-life care at home.
- Equipment can be provided to help remain at home.
- Availability varies by location — discuss with GP or specialist.
- **Advantages:**
  - Familiar environment
  - Comfort and privacy
  - Family close
- **Challenges:**
  - Limited practical support if living alone
  - Potential loneliness

### 2. Care Home
- Many have end-of-life care experience.
- May be supported by a Palliative Care team.
- **Advantages:**
  - 24/7 staff
  - Experienced care providers
  - Often private rooms
  - Can feel like a home over time
- **Challenges:**
  - May not feel like home
  - Negative associations for some

### 3. Hospice
- Provide specialist care for life-limiting or terminal illness.
- Often charity-funded and limited in availability.
- **Advantages:**
  - 24/7 specialist staff
  - Private, peaceful environment
- **Challenges:**
  - May not feel like home
  - Limited capacity

### 4. Hospital
- Common place for end-of-life care.
- May provide private rooms, but not guaranteed.
- **Advantages:**
  - Constant staff presence
- **Challenges:**
  - Can be noisy
  - Less peaceful environment

## Medicines Towards End of Life

When end of life is near, care focuses on comfort and dignity.

- Some long-term benefit medicines (e.g., cholesterol tablets) may be stopped.
- Medicines for symptom control (e.g., painkillers) are usually continued.
- Parkinson’s medicines are generally continued and optimised for symptom control.
- Adjustments may be needed for swallowing difficulties (e.g., switching to a skin patch).
- **Anticipatory medicines** may be provided in advance to manage:
  - Pain
  - Breathlessness
  - Distress or agitation
  - Nausea
  - Secretions  
  These are chosen with Parkinson’s considerations in mind.

---

## Medicines to Avoid in Parkinson’s (Even in Palliative Care)

- **Haloperidol**, **metoclopramide**, and **prochlorperazine** (anti-sickness medicines) should generally be **avoided** in people with Parkinson’s as they can worsen symptoms.  
- **Alternatives** such as **cyclizine** or **ondansetron** should be considered for nausea.  
- **Domperidone** is suitable in Parkinson’s but is not given by injection.

When a person is dying, they may not be able to take pills.  
- Small injections may be used under the skin (subcutaneous) rather than into a vein.  
- If injections are needed very regularly, a pump can provide continuous medication under the skin.

---

## After Death

### Who to Contact
This is understandably a distressing time. It helps to know in advance who to contact:
- GP
- Nursing home manager
- Nursing staff (if in hospital)
- Palliative care nurse or Parkinson’s nurse
- Faith leader (priest, rabbi, minister, etc.)  
They can also help you contact a funeral director for further arrangements.

---

## Practical Tasks
After someone dies, certain tasks must be completed:
- Register the death
- Make funeral arrangements  
  (See the UK Government website: [What to do after someone dies](https://www.gov.uk/after-a-death))

Other considerations:
- Bereavement affects people differently; social support from family and friends can help.
- Some may benefit from additional information, counselling, or specialist bereavement support.
- Support is available from charities, local hospices, and NHS services:
  - **Cruse Bereavement Care**  
    [www.cruse.org.uk](https://www.cruse.org.uk)  
  - NHS Bereavement Resources ([search “bereavement”](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/coping-with-bereavement/))
  - Speak to your GP for local options.

---

## Organ and Tissue Donation
- Many people are in need of organ transplants or tissues.
- Join the NHS Organ Donation Register when registering with a GP, applying for a driving licence, or directly at [organdonation.nhs.uk](https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk).
- Discuss your wishes with loved ones, as they will be contacted after your death.

---

## Donation to Medical Science
- You can arrange to leave your body for medical research or training.  
  See: [Human Tissue Authority – Body Donation](https://www.hta.gov.uk/donating-your-body)
- Parkinson’s research may involve studying the brains of people who had Parkinson’s after death.
- Parkinson’s UK supports a **Brain Bank** at Imperial College London.
