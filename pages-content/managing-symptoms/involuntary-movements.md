# Involuntary Movements (Dyskinesia)
‘Dyskinesias’ are typically quick muscle movements that you cannot control. These movements include wriggling, writhing, twisting, head bobbing, or swaying motions. They can affect one part of the body (e.g. the trunk), arms or legs, or the whole body. 
 
Some people experience dyskinesia when their medications are at the highest levels in the body. Others have dyskinesia when their medications are at the lowest levels in the body (i.e. just before or just after taking medication). 
 
Dyskinesias can range in severity, from some people having it so mildly that they do not notice the movements to others who have severe dyskinesias. Many people with Parkinson’s say their dyskinesias do not bother them, and they would prefer to feel more “on” with dyskinesias and be able to do more, than have fewer dyskinesias but feel more “off” and not be able to do as much.

## What might be causing it?
The exact cause of dyskinesia isn’t known. Experts think it's related to the natural progression of Parkinson’s and the brain becoming more sensitive to dopamine. 
 
It is more common for dyskinesia to develop after a few years of levodopa treatment, but some develop them earlier and others never develop dyskinesias. 
 
Dyskinesia tends to get worse when stressed or anxious.

## What should I do about it?
If dyskinesias aren’t bothering you or impacting on your daily life, then there's nothing you need to do. 
 
If there are lots of extra movements, this can burn extra calories and cause unintended weight loss (see weight & appetite loss page). 
 
There are some ideas below for how to manage your dyskinesia. But if they are impacting your daily life or bothering you, discuss them with your Parkinson’s specialist team.

## What can I try for myself?

### Managing Stress
- Like many Parkinson’s symptoms, dyskinesias are worse when stressed. Finding ways to stay relaxed can be helpful.
- Massage, tai chi, yoga and deep breathing exercises may be helpful tools in managing stress.

### Let your body guide you
If you notice particular times when your movements are good (e.g. feeling “on”) and you don’t have extra movements, make the most of these times to do things you enjoy. 

### Explain to others
You can explain to others that the extra movements are part of your Parkinson’s and nothing to be concerned about.

## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “It can be brought on by all sorts of different things and can cause falls and the like. If we go out, we try and plan it so that we go out at what is likely to be the best window of opportunity with the medication. If we leave it too long, then [dyskinesia] problems occur.”

Healthcare professionals are likely to ask more questions, so you could think about these in advance. You could record them in your <a href="/learn/my-reminders-and-notes" class="internal-link">_My Reminders and Notes_</a> section to bring to the appointment.
