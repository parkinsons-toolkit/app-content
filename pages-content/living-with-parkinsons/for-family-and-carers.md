# Guidance for Families and Carers
If a loved one is told that they have Parkinson’s it is an adjustment for you both. Whether you are reading this following a recent diagnosis or after they have had Parkinson’s for a while, we hope this section will provide useful information on how to support the person with Parkinson’s by supporting yourself.

We know Parkinson’s is progressive and a complex condition. This means that your role and involvement will change over time and there will be different challenges along the way. Everyone’s journey is unique and will depend on your personal situation. It will also depend on your relationship to that person (partner, sister, brother, child or friend). You are likely to experience a range of emotions, which is normal and expected. Supporting a loved one with Parkinson’s can be a rewarding experience. There will also be more difficult experiences. These may cause you to have challenging feelings to cope with, such as: 
- Feeling anxious or worried about the future
- Feelings of anger
- Feelings of guilt
- Feeling stressed, often showing itself as physical symptoms such as “butterflies” in the stomach or difficulty sleeping
- Depression, despair or feelings of hopelessness
- Feeling trapped
- Feeling lost/lonely
- Feeling isolated

These feelings are all normal and very common. In fact, they are so common that a recent report published by the Mental Health Foundation stated that:
- 71% of people of those studied, and classified as ‘carers’ have poor physical or mental health.
- 84% of those studied feel more stressed, 78% feel more anxious and 55% reported depression as a result of their caring role.
- 38% of young carers report having a mental health problem, yet only half report receiving additional support from a member of staff at school.

It is vitally important to be aware of this and take steps to look after yourself.

While negative, challenging emotions can be part of caring for someone with Parkinson’s, it is important not to become overwhelmed by them. To prevent these unhelpful and challenging emotions escalating, there are many things you can do to help and look after yourself. It is also important where possible to accept help and support.

This means it is not just what you can do on your own (that is, using your own internal resources such as skills, and abilities: your resilience). It is also what you can do with support. That is what makes the most of your ability to cope with any situation.

This means not only seeking support when you experience unhelpful and challenging emotions or begin to feel overwhelmed by them. It is also finding support from the start that can help to prevent any unhelpful/challenging emotions from escalating.

---

## Looking after your general wellbeing
As well as reacting to challenging emotions when they arise, it is also important to be proactive, i.e. to look ahead so you can be in more control when dealing with challenging emotions. Looking ahead and putting strategies and practical things in place can be of help when juggling multiple commitments. This will help you to be in a better place to cope with the demands of being a carer. It could also prevent stress or burnout as much as possible. You can improve your mental wellbeing and resilience, i.e. your ability to cope, in a number of ways. 

**_Tips for looking after your general wellbeing:_**
- Try to connect with others
- Exercise regularly (in a way that fits in with your situation)
- Eat as well as you can
- Try to get enough sleep
- Try to engage in hobbies and interests (in a way that fits in with your situation, even 5-minute blocks throughout the day can have a benefit)
- Reframe unhelpful/challenging thoughts/emotions — think about things differently
- As well as planning ahead, try to be in the present during your day-to-day activities

While many carers are selfless in what they do, it is important to remember that you are also important. It is good to try to consider what your own needs are for your best health, self-care and support. The advice on airplanes to “put your own oxygen mask on first” is also true for carers. Your physical, medical and emotional needs are as important as those of the person with Parkinson’s. Doing what you can to look after yourself is essential to help you be in the best place to support them and yourself. 

Please see the _Finances_ page for information about financial support that may help you look after your own wellbeing too. Also, the _Complementary therapy_ pages for information of activities you may like to try for your wellbeing.

## My Experience
People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences:

> “For anyone that is a carer, they must have something for themselves, either exercise or going out for coffee with friends. You have to do that ... when I’ve been out, he’ll say, how was the class? and I’ll say, ‘oh, I’m exhausted’. And then you’ve got things to talk about.”  
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

## Coping with stress
Stress is something we all encounter. Life changes, such as personal problems, relationship difficulties, pressures at work or moving to a new house, can all cause stress. A certain level of stress can be good for the body: it is motivating and alerts the mind. However, if stress becomes overwhelming or goes on for a long time, it can take its toll both physically and emotionally. In supporting someone with Parkinson’s, it is likely you will be exposed to many more things that cause you stress. It is important to be aware of the signs of stress and address them where possible.

### Tips for coping with stress

- **Identify triggers.** Try to identify the things that you find stressful. This varies from person to person and their situation. Once you are aware of what may be your triggers, you can then find ways to address them. Sometimes it is not possible to address what is stressing you, but recognising this can reduce stress in itself.
- **Take regular breaks.** Supporting someone with Parkinson’s can be demanding. It is important that you try and take regular breaks. Whether this be a few minutes each hour (just to close your eyes and breathe), a few hours a day to yourself, or a weekend away. Please see the _Finances_ page for information about financial support that may help you look after your own wellbeing in this way. Support groups and online resources can be helpful ways of taking a break.
- **Find ways to relax.** This might be reading a book, listening to music, doing some breathing exercises or mini stretches. Please see the _Complementary therapy_ pages for more ideas.
- **Get organised.** Being a carer means additional responsibilities. Try to stay on top of these by making a list of jobs and tackling one at a time. Don’t be afraid to ask for support. Vary the jobs, using interesting ones as rewards. Remember the “Four Ds” of time management:
  - **DO!**
  - **DITCH!**
  - **DELEGATE!**
  - **DELAY!**
- **Reassess what is important.** Think about:
  - What is important now?
  - What is necessary?
  - What is giving you too much stress?
  - What can you change?
  - Can you work towards a better balance in your life, including what is important to you?
  - Who can you call?
- **Confide in someone.** Don’t keep stress bottled up. Even if there is nothing anyone can do to change the stress, sharing can help. This can be through friends, family, online groups, or even journaling.

---

### Traps to avoid

- **Being hard on yourself.** Remember the concept of “good enough.” Focus on what you are doing well rather than what you think you’re not doing.
- **Not communicating your needs.** Be specific about the help you require. People aren’t mind-readers, and your needs may change over time.
- **Not being assertive.** State your needs clearly and explain why they are important to you.

## My Experience

People affected by Parkinson’s describe their experiences.

> “If you can cope with one day at a time, it’s less stress… just concentrate on today. It works. Less stress for me, less stress for him… I’ll say to anybody ‘take one day at a time. It’s less stress’. I think if you take the stress away you can cope.”  
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

## Coping with low mood and depression

Everyone experiences low mood from time to time. When this becomes persistent and interferes with your life, it may be diagnosed as depression. Depressive feelings are very common and typically follow a loss, such as bereavement, divorce or job loss. Usually, this is temporary and something we can recover from naturally. Occasionally we may need additional support.

Caring for someone with Parkinson’s can put you at risk of depression. This is because you may be exposed to more losses and more things you find stressful. You may also be unable to do the activities that can help prevent low mood and depression. The effects of depression are very real and can interfere with your caring role. Depression can build up gradually, so you may not realise how much it is affecting you. Knowing the symptoms, who to talk to, and what treatments are available can help you deal with depression quickly.

### Signs of depression

Depression is when we feel low or sad, and can’t find any pleasure in life. Many of us feel like this sometimes, but depression is when these feelings last longer and are more extreme.

Other symptoms of depression include:

- Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, worried or tearful
- Feeling unable to cope with everyday things that you would not have thought twice about in the past
- Losing your appetite, losing weight and/or having trouble sleeping
- In extreme cases, thinking about harming yourself or other people

If you see any of these symptoms in yourself, you may be affected by depression. It's important to seek help from a GP or your Parkinson’s nurse if you think you may be depressed. Don’t feel like a failure for needing help, and don’t feel judged or fear that seeking help puts the welfare of the person with Parkinson’s at risk. Medical professionals are fully aware of the pressures of caring. Many people wait a long time before seeking help, but the sooner you do so, the sooner help can be put in place.

Treatment for depression can involve self-help strategies, lifestyle changes, talking therapies and/or medication. Most people benefit from a combination of these. The treatment will depend on your symptoms and situation.

**Tips for coping with low mood and depression:**

- Regular exercise
- Eating healthily
- Sleeping well
- Talking with friends, family, support groups
- Doing things you enjoy (e.g. listening to music)
- Doing things that give you a sense of purpose and meaning (e.g. work, volunteering)
- Avoiding alcohol

## Coping with anxiety

Anxiety is a very normal emotion — it is our response to threat. For humans, threat can come in many different forms: physical, emotional or social. The threat can be in the present, past, or future. At a biological level, when a threat is detected, adrenaline is released into the bloodstream to help us respond. This fight/flight response happens whether the danger is real or perceived. It’s the body’s alarm system — our way of staying safe.

Caring for someone with Parkinson’s can increase the risk of developing anxiety. This can be general worry about many things, acute anxiety (panic attacks), or anxiety in specific situations (e.g. social activities).

### Signs of anxiety

Anxiety can affect you physically, mentally, and in how you behave. Symptoms include:

- Increased heart rate and palpitations
- Feeling hot and sweaty
- Pins and needles
- Light-headedness or dizziness
- Muscular tension
- “Butterflies” in the stomach
- Breathing faster and more shallowly
- Problems concentrating
- Feeling wary or on edge all the time
- Avoiding situations or not going out
- Feeling unable to cope or overwhelmed

If you recognise these symptoms in yourself, you may be affected by anxiety. Seek help from a GP or your Parkinson’s nurse if needed. Treatment may include self-help strategies, lifestyle changes, talking therapies, and/or medication. Most people benefit from a combination.

**Tips for coping with anxiety:**

- Regular exercise
- Eating a healthy diet
- Getting enough sleep
- Talking with friends, family, support groups
- Using relaxation techniques
- Practising controlled breathing

## Coping with uncertainty

A common source of stress and anxiety for the person with Parkinson’s and their loved ones is uncertainty about the future. Parkinson’s is unpredictable — symptoms progress over time but vary greatly between people and even from day to day. While it’s natural to prepare for changes, it’s impossible to plan for every scenario.

**Tips for coping with uncertainty:**

- **Continue to plan.** Don’t let uncertainty stop you from planning important things. Having something to look forward to gives you a sense of control.
- **Be flexible.** Like a tree bending in the wind, flexibility helps you adjust. Avoid relying on just one plan — instead, have options and trust in your ability to adapt.
- **Get knowledge.** The right information at the right time can help. Others may have already found solutions to similar worries, but avoid over-preparing for situations that may never happen.
- **Worry vs. problem solving.** Ask: “Has it happened yet?” and “Is there anything I can do about it?” If no, it’s likely worry. If yes, take action and reassess.
- **Share.** Talk with someone you trust. Speaking or writing down your concerns can make them more manageable and provide new perspectives.
- **Develop a good support network.** Strong relationships and resources increase resilience.
- **Enjoy the here and now.** Don’t let concerns about the future overshadow the present.

> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

> “The advice I would give to people is that you prepare yourself a schedule of things that you should be doing for and with that person during your day. And where it varies, you mark it up and vary it as… but unless you write it down and give yourself something to work to, you can go wrong.”  
> _(Carer of someone with Parkinson’s)_

## Coping with guilt

Guilt is one of the most common emotions experienced by carers. It can arise from feeling you should be doing more or doing things better, from feeling you shouldn’t complain because the person with Parkinson’s has it worse, or from doing something they would like to do but can’t. The fact you feel guilty likely reflects that you are a good and caring person. It’s important not to let guilt stop you from looking after yourself or expressing your feelings.

**Tips for managing guilt:**

- **Do not compare.** Your feelings matter. Your life has also changed, and your emotions are valid.
- **Avoid the resentment–guilt cycle.** It’s normal to feel angry, hurt, or resentful. Instead of pushing these feelings away, try to understand and manage them.
- **Talk it through.**
  - If possible, talk with the person you care for — they may also feel guilty about the impact on you.
  - Talk to friends and family, and let them know how to support you.
  - Connect with other carers through groups or online forums.
  - Use confidential helplines like the Samaritans if you feel overwhelmed.
  - Speak to your GP, who may refer you to counselling or local support services.

## Coping with loss and grief

Supporting someone with Parkinson’s often involves acknowledging and coping with different types of loss. These losses can occur at different times and stages, leading to an ongoing or repeated grieving process.

It can be helpful to think about the **different stages of grief**, but remember — not everyone experiences all the stages or goes through them in a set order.

## Coping with changes to sexual relationships

A few ways Parkinson’s can affect sexual relationships are:

- Tremor, stiffness or rigidity, and/or slowness of movement affecting sexual performance.
- Fatigue affecting the time of day when it is most convenient to be intimate.
- Bladder or bowel symptoms causing anxiety around sexual performance, with fears of incontinence.
- Medication side-effects causing changes in sex drive. Some Parkinson’s medications can cause increased sex drive, alongside other impulsive behaviours, such as compulsive gambling or reckless spending. This may be experienced by the partner as more frequent demands for intimacy or changes in sexual preference that may make the partner uncomfortable. In contrast, some medications, such as antidepressants, can suppress sex drive and arousal.
- Mood changes in themselves can affect sex drive. Depression often results in a loss of sex drive.
- Changes in confidence and self-esteem can affect sex drive. People may feel less attractive or less able sexually.
- As a carer, you may worry about placing demands on the person for sex or worried that it may cause harm in some way.
- If you have never been comfortable talking about sex, any of these problems may make it even harder for you and you might begin to avoid sex altogether.

## Tips for coping with changes in sexual relationships

- Think about altering what you do together to take account of changing physical abilities
- Make sure medications are at their most effective to reduce the interference from any symptoms
- Find different ways to be intimate with each other
- Maintain a good relationship outside of sex
- Speak to your health professionals if concerned. This is particularly important if there are issues with increased sex drive, because this can escalate if left unchecked
- Consider talking to your GP or Parkinson’s nurse about medications if you are concerned about any of the physical aspects (e.g. incontinence or erectile dysfunction)

## Coping with later stages of Parkinson’s

As Parkinson’s progresses, it can cause greater disability and have more of an impact on everyday life. In addition, it can sometimes cause other health problems such as infections. This all means that you may have more to do to care for the person with Parkinson’s. This can affect your life in many ways.

- **Emotionally.** It is normal to experience lots of different emotions about the caring role, particularly as needs become greater. Carers can feel stressed and overwhelmed, having little time for themselves or their own needs. Carers may also feel isolated, seeing friends and family less often/friends not contacting them much anymore or no longer contacting them. Naturally, this can cause you to feel sad, frustrated or isolated. If you are feeling like this, remember these feeling are understandable. It is also still good to talk to others about how you are feeling.
- **Physically.** It is important that you look after your own health just as much as that of the person you are caring for. As well as any regular check-ups and screenings, you should also try to make sure you give yourself that little window of time for relaxation, eating well and exercising.
- **Work.** Juggling working and caring can be very difficult. You have a legal right to request flexible working to help you manage your added responsibilities. Flexible working may involve working compressed hours, different work hours, working from home or a different site, or working part-time. You also have the right to take time off in an emergency. Further information can be found on the GOV.UK website, or [www.carersuk.org](http://www.carersuk.org)
- **Finances.** Caring can have an impact on your finances. This is especially if you have had to give up work in order to support someone. As a carer, you are entitled to a Carer’s Assessment from your local social services team. This will assess if you are eligible for any extra support, including financial assistance. Please see the Finance page for further information.
- **Transport.** If you or your passenger has severe mobility problems, you may be allowed to apply for a Blue Badge. This means you are free from some parking restrictions and have access to selected parking spaces. There may however be additional restrictions in your borough. Check the GOV.UK website: [www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge](https://www.gov.uk/apply-blue-badge). Your local authority may also offer additional reduced fare schemes for people with disabilities. For example, in London, the Freedom Pass lets older and people with disabilities use London buses, tubes and trains for free. Day centres and clubs can also help with transport in some cases, so you don’t have to arrange this yourself. See the Travel page for more information.

## Coping with changes in thinking and behaviour

As well as physical changes, there may also be changes in thinking abilities. There may also sometimes be the development of hallucinations and delusions.

- **Changes in thinking abilities.** In later stages of Parkinson’s, there can be greater difficulty with memory, concentration and speed of thinking. These can cause confusion. When these difficulties are particularly marked, you may hear this referred to as Parkinson’s dementia. See _Thinking and Remembering_ for more information.
- **Hallucinations.** It is common for people with Parkinson’s to experience changes in their visual abilities. They might describe visual illusions. This is when something that is real looks different; for example, the tree outside might look like a person, or the carpet pattern looks like it’s moving. In the later stages, the person with Parkinson’s may also develop hallucinations. These are usually visual, which is seeing things that are not there. There can also be hallucinations of sounds, smells, tastes and touch. Usually, these are not distressing, and need no treatment. If they do become distressing, they can be treated with medication. It is also possible that these symptoms are caused by other medical conditions. They can also be a side-effect of medications. It is therefore important that your doctor knows.
- **Delusions.** Less commonly, people can develop delusions, becoming committed to a thought or belief that isn’t true. This can include paranoia or suspiciousness, jealousy within loving relationships, or believing they have special powers. If these occur, these symptoms can be treated with medications.

### Tips for coping with changes in thinking and behaviour

- Allow the person extra time to complete tasks
- Try not to rush or overload them, or distract them when they are doing a task
- Repeat any important information
- Keep a diary/timetable with the week’s important events or appointments in a central place
- Keep a note-pad and pen by the phone
- Keep to a daily routine, with the same time for meals and bedtime as much as possible
- Avoid unfamiliar or confusing environments
- Use a nightlight or low level lighting at night-time to reduce any confusion

## Coping with the future

As care needs increase, you and the person with Parkinson’s may wish to consider what extra support you might be able to apply for:

- You are entitled to a Carer’s Assessment from your local social services team. Following this, you may be able to apply for home care services. This includes formal carers, or funds for managing the care needs yourself.
- Social services may suggest using telecare/assistive technology. This may include such items as portable alarms, which can help if there is a risk of falling.
- Social services can give you information about local day centres, lunch clubs and exercise groups. Some of these would be open to you both. This can help you both keep socially and physically active. Some will be for the person with Parkinson’s only. This would allow you to have a break and do something for yourself. Social services can arrange respite breaks. These might be residential, when the person with Parkinson’s stays in a care home or hospital. They might be home-based instead. This is when someone stays with the person with Parkinson’s in their own home whilst you take a break.
- Social services can also advise on residential care options, should care needs become too difficult to manage at home. These can include extra-care sheltered housing, which enables independent living with support close at hand. Otherwise 24-hour care is available in a residential or nursing home. Social services will be able to advise on the financial aspects of this.

You might want to plan for the future, sometimes known as advance care planning. This could involve making Lasting Power of Attorney, Advance Decisions and preparing for end of life.

- **Lasting Power of Attorney.** LPA is a legal document that lets someone appoint another person(s) to help make decisions on their behalf. This can be important to have in place, should the person lose the capacity to make decisions for themselves. There are two types of LPA: health and welfare, and property and financial affairs. You can find the documents online. You can then sign and send to the Office of the Public Guardian.
- **Advance Decisions.** The Mental Capacity Act allows anyone with capacity, which is the ability to make their own decisions, to make an Advance Decision. An Advance Decision sets out the treatments they do not want, should they lose capacity in the future. If the person with Parkinson’s has lost capacity and you are the appointed attorney, you can do this on their behalf.
- **Advanced Statement.** This is a written statement that sets down your preferences, wishes, beliefs and values about your future care.
- **Planning for end of life.** The person with Parkinson’s may wish to put their affairs, in order to feel reassured that their wishes are known. This can involve making wills, LPAs and/or Advance Decision. In Scotland this is known as an Advanced Directive, and used to be called a Living Will. The person with Parkinson’s might also want to consider what would be a ‘good death’ for them, in terms of feeling at peace. They might wish to consult palliative care services, which can be accessed through the GP or Parkinson’s nurse.

Further information can be found in the Legal, End of life and Future Care pages.

### Tips for coping with the future

- Start a conversation with the person you support about their views and wishes for the future. If this is not possible then finding someone for you both to speak to in your support network, or to a health professionals may be helpful.
- Share this with your wider family, friends and the health care team
- Make an LPA and any Advance Decision or advance statement of wishes
- Identify who might be best to help you complete forms if needed
- Inform the person with Parkinson’s health care team that you have made these
