# General Medical Advice

As well as managing Parkinson’s, there are general medical recommendations to improve long-term health. The following advice is based on general NHS guidance, tailored for people with Parkinson’s. The focus is on things you can do, or support you can access, that may help to prevent problems in the future.

## Vaccinations

Vaccinations are medications designed to prevent infections. Vaccination schedules change over time according to the latest scientific research. At present (July 2020), the recommendations for adults with Parkinson’s are:

* **Flu**: Annual influenza vaccination for all people with Parkinson’s (this is universally recommended for those aged 65 years and over). The annual influenza vaccination should be considered for household members and those who care for people with Parkinson’s.
* **Pneumonia**: One-off vaccination\* for all people with Parkinson’s (this is universally recommended for those aged 65 years and over).
  \* People who don’t have a working spleen or have chronic kidney disease may require boosters every 5 years.
* **Shingles**: One-off vaccination when you are 70 years old.

These are all delivered as injections, usually into the arm. You should not have vaccines if you are allergic to the ingredients or are ill at the time. More information can be found on the NHS website, under ‘Vaccinations’.

## Blood Pressure

### What is blood pressure?

Your heart pushes blood around the body through a network of blood vessels, similar to the way a pump pushes fluid through pipes. Your blood pressure is recorded as two numbers:

* **Systolic (top number)**: Pressure as the heart is pushing.
* **Diastolic (bottom number)**: Pressure as the heart relaxes.

Many factors affect blood pressure. It varies between people and is constantly changing. Parkinson’s and its treatments can cause low or variable blood pressure. Age and lifestyle can cause high blood pressure.

### High blood pressure

* Increases with age and lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol, caffeine, poor diet, inactivity, and stress.
* Above 140/90mmHg (under 80) or 150/90mmHg (over 80) is generally considered high.
* Often has no symptoms but may cause heart attacks or strokes.
* Healthy lifestyle and medication can help lower it.

### Low blood pressure

* Causes: Parkinson’s, medications, infections.
* Below 90/60mmHg is generally low.
* Symptoms include: dizziness, fainting, nausea, blurred vision, weakness, confusion.
* May not need treatment unless symptomatic.
* Often worsens when changing position (postural hypotension).

## When to Check Blood Pressure

* Everyone over 40: at least every 5 years.
* People with Parkinson’s: usually more frequent, often at least yearly.
* Can be tested at GP, hospital, pharmacy, or home using a monitor.
